What are AWS managed policies for Network Access Analyzer and how do they function?,"AWS managed policies for Network Access Analyzer are predefined permission sets that make it easier to assign permissions to users, groups, and roles within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. AWS services are responsible for maintaining and periodically updating these managed policies to support new features or operations, ensuring that permissions do not get removed and existing permissions do not break. Notably, these managed policies cannot be modified by users. For instance, the AmazonVPCNetworkAccessAnalyzerFullAccessPolicy is an AWS managed policy that provides comprehensive permissions for creating, analyzing, and deleting Network Access Scopes, as well as describing various network path resources like firewalls and gateways. Additionally, AWS also offers managed policies designed for specific job functions across multiple services.","AWS managed policies for Network Access Analyzer are pre-built sets of permissions that simplify the process of managing access to Network Access Analyzer resources. These policies are created and maintained by AWS and are designed to cover common use cases, such as allowing users to create, view, and delete network access analyses. Users can attach these policies to their IAM identities to grant them the necessary permissions without having to create their own policies. The policies are stored in the AWS managed policies section of the IAM console and can be edited or deleted as needed. AWS recommends using managed policies for simplified access management and to ensure compliance with various AWS services."
