https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-migrate-ipv6.html,How can you migrate an IPv4-only Amazon VPC to support IPv6 addressing?,"To migrate an IPv4-only Amazon VPC to support IPv6 addressing, you need to go through a series of steps that enables your VPC and resources like instances to operate in dual-stack mode, meaning they can communicate over both IPv4 and IPv6. The migration process involves associating an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC and each subnet, updating route tables to route IPv6 traffic correctly, updating security group rules to include IPv6 rules, and then assigning IPv6 addresses to your instances. It is important to note that you cannot transition from IPv4-only subnets to IPv6-only subnets, but AWS allows VPCs to operate with both IP versions in parallel. During the process, you must ensure that your instances types support IPv6 and update all inbound and outbound rules that may have been set for IPv4 to accommodate IPv6 traffic."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/DHCPOptionSet.html,"How do you view your DHCP option sets in Amazon VPC, and what settings are available by default?","In Amazon VPC, to view your DHCP option sets, you can access them by using the Amazon VPC console or through the command line using describe-dhcp-options (AWS CLI) or Get-EC2DhcpOption (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell). For a default DHCP option set, the settings that have values include the ""Domain name"" and ""Domain name servers"". To use the console for viewing, you would need to open the Amazon VPC console, navigate to the ""DHCP option sets"" section, and then choose the ID of a DHCP option set to open its details page. The domain name and domain name servers are essential for domain name resolution within your VPC."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/subnet-cidr-reservation.html,What is a subnet CIDR reservation in Amazon VPC and how are they used with network interfaces?,"A subnet CIDR reservation in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) is a designated range of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses that are set aside to prevent AWS from assigning them to other network interfaces. Users can specify how to use these reserved IP addresses with two available options: 'Prefix', where AWS automatically assigns addresses from the reserved range to network interfaces, and 'Explicit', where users manually assign IP addresses to network interfaces. Although a subnet CIDR reservation can include IP addresses that are already in use, it will not unassign those currently in use. Furthermore, users can reserve multiple CIDR ranges per subnet, but these ranges must not overlap. When a subnet reservation is deleted, any unused IP addresses become available for AWS to reassign, without affecting in-use addresses."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/internet-gateway-subnet.html,How does the middlebox routing wizard facilitate the inspection of traffic destined for a specific subnet in Amazon VPC?,"The middlebox routing wizard in Amazon VPC helps to inspect traffic going to a specific subnet by automating the creation and association of necessary route tables. When an EC2 instance with a firewall appliance is set up in a subnet separate from the one receiving traffic, say subnet B, the wizard establishes a route table for the internet gateway, the destination subnet (subnet B), and the middlebox subnet (subnet C). It then dissociates any current route tables from the relevant resources and attaches the freshly created tables to the internet gateway, subnet C, and subnet B. Additionally, it tags the new route tables with their origin and creation date. This tool is designed to simplify the process compared to manually setting up routes for traffic between subnet B and the internet gateway."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-cloudwatch.html,What are the benefits of monitoring Network Address Usage (NAU) in an Amazon VPC using Amazon CloudWatch?,"Monitoring Network Address Usage (NAU) within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using Amazon CloudWatch offers several key benefits. By accessing statistics known as metrics, users can keep track of their VPC's growth over time. This is particularly valuable as approaching or exceeding NAU quotas in a VPC would prevent the launch of new resources such as EC2 instances and other services. Utilizing CloudWatch to monitor these metrics allows users to plan effectively for VPC expansion, set up notifications for when certain thresholds are crossed, and forecast when a VPC is nearing its maximum capacity, thereby ensuring the uninterrupted deployment of new services and maintaining operational stability."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/security-iam.html,How does AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) support control over access to Amazon VPC resources?,"AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a critical service provided by AWS that enables administrators to securely manage access to AWS services and resources, including Amazon VPC. IAM administrators are endowed with the power to determine who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to utilize Amazon VPC resources. Authentication can be achieved through various methods, including signing in as the AWS account root user, as an IAM user, or by assuming an IAM role. IAM also supports federated identities, where users can sign in with credentials from an identity source such as IAM Identity Center, corporate single sign-on, or even social identities like Google or Facebook. Additionally, IAM allows for granular access control through policies that administrators attach to users, groups, roles, or resources, outlining specific permissions under defined conditions. This intricate system is designed to ensure that the right individuals have the appropriate level of access to perform their jobs without compromising security and is available to AWS customers at no additional charge."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/create-vpc-peering-connection.html,What are the steps to create a VPC peering connection in Amazon VPC?,"To create a VPC peering connection in Amazon VPC, begin by requesting to peer with another VPC, which can be in your account or a different AWS account, and even across different regions. After creating a request, the accepter VPC's owner must approve it to activate the connection. It's crucial to ensure that there are no overlapping IPv4 CIDR blocks between the VPCs to prevent the connection from failing. The Amazon VPC console provides an interface where the user can name the peering connection, select the VPCs involved, and, after accepting the request, update the route tables to enable traffic across the new peering connection. Commands for creating a VPC peering connection via the AWS CLI and AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell are also available."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/tm-example-inbound-tcp-udp.html,How can inbound TCP and UDP traffic be mirrored to multiple appliances using Amazon VPC Traffic Mirroring?,"To mirror inbound TCP and UDP traffic to multiple appliances using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) Traffic Mirroring, one must create distinct traffic mirror targets and sessions for each protocol directed at different appliances. The process involves six steps: First, create a traffic mirror target for Appliance A (Target A), suitable for TCP traffic. Second, set up a similar target for Appliance B (Target B) for UDP traffic. Third, generate a traffic mirror filter (Filter 1) with specific rules for incoming TCP traffic. Fourth, another traffic mirror filter (Filter 2) is created for UDP traffic. In the fifth step, a traffic mirror session is established for monitoring the inbound TCP traffic using the Filter 1 and Target A. Finally, step six requires the creation of a separate traffic mirror session for UDP traffic, utilizing Filter 2 and Target B. This setup ensures that TCP traffic is sent to Appliance A and UDP traffic to Appliance B, with each having their own filters and rules for effective traffic monitoring."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/tm-example-non-vpc.html,"How can one set up AWS to monitor non-local VPC traffic, and what are the key components involved in this process?","To monitor non-local VPC traffic in AWS, one needs to set up traffic mirroring by following three key steps. The process involves creating a traffic mirror target for the monitoring appliance, which could be the appliance's network interface, a Network Load Balancer, or a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint. Then, a traffic mirror filter is established with specific rules for both outbound and inbound traffic; for outbound, it rejects all traffic with a destination IP within the VPC CIDR block while accepting all other outbound traffic, and inversely for inbound traffic. Finally, a traffic mirror session is configured with a source, the aforementioned target, and a filter that includes a rule for TCP inbound traffic. The configuration ensures that all traffic leaving the VPC or originating from outside is mirrored for monitoring, except for the traffic that stays within the VPC."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/getting-started.html,What is the purpose of the AWS PrivateLink tutorial described on the Amazon VPC documentation page?,"The purpose of the AWS PrivateLink tutorial on the Amazon VPC documentation page is to demonstrate the process of setting up and using AWS PrivateLink to allow an EC2 instance located within a private subnet to securely send a request to Amazon CloudWatch without exposing the traffic to the public internet. The tutorial includes steps such as creating a VPC with public and private subnets, launching instances, setting up key pairs and security groups, testing CloudWatch access, creating a VPC endpoint for CloudWatch, and testing the VPC endpoint, culminating with guidance on how to clean up the resources if they are no longer needed. The documentation is structured to guide users through each step with the aim of setting up a secure and private connection to CloudWatch for instances that are not directly exposed to the public internet."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/transit-gateway-isolated-shared.html,How can you configure a transit gateway to support multiple isolated VPCs while providing shared services in AWS?,"You can configure a transit gateway in AWS to act as multiple isolated routers, each with a single route table for its VPC attachments. These isolated routers allow VPC attachments to route packets between each other within the same isolated router, but not between different isolated routers. However, all attachments can route packets to and from shared services. This scenario is useful when there are groups that need to remain isolated for the main part of their operations, like a production system, but still require access to certain shared services. The configuration involves creating multiple VPCs and transit gateway attachments, as well as setting up routing tables that properly segregate the traffic while allowing communication with shared services and a Site-to-Site VPN when needed."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-route-tables.html,"How can you create, manage, and delete transit gateway route tables in Amazon VPC?","In Amazon VPC, to manage transit gateway route tables, you can perform various actions such as create, view, associate, disassociate, propagate routes to, disable route propagation, create static or blackhole routes, replace routes, export routes to Amazon S3, and delete route tables. To create a route table, you can use the Amazon VPC console or the AWS CLI with the `create-transit-gateway-route-table` command. Viewing the route tables and their details is also possible through the console or by using various AWS CLI commands like `describe-transit-gateway-route-tables`. Associations between a route table and a transit gateway attachment can be managed, and route propagation can be enabled or disabled to control how routes are added to a table. Additionally, static routes can be created to direct traffic for specific targets, or blackhole routes can be used to drop traffic. Routes can be exported to an Amazon S3 bucket in a JSON format for analysis or record-keeping. Finally, when a route table is no longer needed, it can be deleted using the console or the AWS CLI `delete-transit-gateway-route-table` command."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/working-with-multicast.html,"What is the purpose of multicast on Amazon VPC's transit gateways, and what are some of its key concepts?","Multicast on Amazon VPC's transit gateways is designed to facilitate the delivery of a single stream of data to multiple receiving computers simultaneously. It enables routing multicast traffic between subnets of attached Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), acting as a multicast router for instances that send traffic intended for multiple instances that receive the traffic. Key concepts of multicast include the multicast domain, which segments a multicast network into domains with the transit gateway functioning as multiple multicast routers; the multicast group, which is a set of hosts that exchange multicast traffic identified by a group IP address; Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), which manages multicast group membership dynamically; multicast source, defined as an elastic network interface on a supported EC2 instance that sends multicast traffic; and multicast group member, which is an elastic network interface on a supported EC2 instance that receives the multicast traffic. Additional considerations related to multicast include regional support, requirements for a transit gateway that supports multicast, management of multicast group membership, and multicast routing limitations."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/transit-gateway-quotas.html,What are the general service quotas for AWS Transit Gateways and how can they be managed?,"AWS Transit Gateways come with specific service quotas, or limits, which are generally region-specific. An AWS account has defaults set for various components such as the number of transit gateways per account (default is 5) and CIDR blocks per transit gateway (default is 5), with some quotas being adjustable. Users can view and manage these quotas through the Service Quotas console, where they can see default values and request increases for adjustable quotas. If an adjustable quota is not available in the Service Quotas console, a support case can be opened for assistance. Additionally, certain quotas such as the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for various connections, the number of attachments per transit gateway, and multicast settings also have predefined limits, with some being capable of adjustment upon request."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/doc-history.html,What are the recent updates to AWS Transit Gateways as listed in the document history?,"AWS Transit Gateways have undergone several updates, with the most recent being the addition of bandwidth limits to AWS Transit Gateway Quotas on August 14, 2023. Before that, on July 14, 2022, support for Transit Gateway Flow Logs was introduced, facilitating the monitoring and logging of network traffic between transit gateways. Similarly, on July 13, 2022, the capability to use policy tables for setting up dynamic routing for transit gateways was added. The AWS Network Manager became a standalone guide, no longer included with the AWS Transit Gateway User Guide, on December 2, 2021. On the preceding day, peering connections within the same region were enabled. Older updates include the introduction of Transit Gateway Connect, Appliance mode, support for prefix list references, CloudWatch metrics for transit gateway attachments, Network Manager Route Analyzer, and peering connections between different regions.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/enable-integ-ipam-outside-org-considerations.html,What should be considered when integrating Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) with accounts outside of your organization?,"When integrating Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) IP Address Manager (IPAM) with external accounts, it is important to be aware of what data is shared and how resource discoveries function. When sharing a resource discovery, only IP address and account status monitoring data are exchanged. Tools such as the 'get-ipam-discovered-resource-cidrs' and 'get-ipam-discovered-accounts' CLI commands, or the corresponding GetIpamDiscoveredResourceCidrs and GetIpamDiscoveredAccounts APIs, can be used to view this data before sharing. However, no organizational data, like names of Organizational Units, are shared for resource discoveries that monitor across an organization. Additionally, a resource discovery created within an owner account will monitor all visible resources. If a third-party AWS service, managing resources for multiple customers, shares this resource discovery, it could inadvertently grant visibility of these resources to the end-users, potentially exposing other customers' resources. Hence, third-party AWS services must be cautious in how they create and share resource discoveries, or consider using separate accounts for each customer to avoid such privacy issues."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/enable-integ-ipam-outside-org-process.html,"How do you integrate Amazon IPAM with AWS accounts outside of your organization, and what are the steps involved in this process?","Integrating Amazon IPAM with AWS accounts outside of your organization is a multi-step process involving four specific types of AWS accounts: the Primary Org Owner, Primary Org IPAM Account, Secondary Org Owner, and Secondary Org Admin Account. Firstly, the Primary Org Owner designates the Primary Org IPAM Account, which then creates an IPAM. The Secondary Org Owner designates the Secondary Org Admin Account, which sets up a resource discovery shared with the Primary Org IPAM Account using AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM). The Primary Org IPAM accepts the shared resource discovery and associates it with their IPAM, thereby enabling monitoring and management of IPAM resources by accounts in the Secondary Org. Optionally, the Primary Org IPAM Account can share IPAM pools with Secondary Org member accounts or disassociate from the resource discovery to cease management. If the Secondary Org chooses to disengage, they can unshare or delete the resource discovery."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/intro-create-ipv4-pools.html,How can you create a hierarchical IPv4 IPAM pool structure in Amazon VPC?,"To create a hierarchical IPv4 IP address management (IPAM) pool structure within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), you need to follow a set of guidelines to define the hierarchy of pools across multiple AWS regions and scopes. This structure includes a private scope with a top-level pool designated by a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/8, under which regional pools can be created, such as a regional pool in AWS Region 2 with a CIDR of 10.0.0.0/16. Beneath the regional pool, more specific pools can be established for particular use cases, such as a development pool with a narrower CIDR of 10.0.0.0/24, and even further allocations for individual VPCs, exemplified by a 10.0.0.0/25 block. Each of these pools obtains a segment of the address space from the top-level CIDR block, allowing for structured and organized IP address allocation across the AWS cloud environment."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/allocate-cidrs-ipam.html,"How can CIDRs be allocated from an IPAM pool in Amazon VPC, and what does the documentation provide guidance on?","You can allocate Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks from an IP address manager (IPAM) pool in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) in two main ways: automatically, by using an AWS service that's integrated with IPAM (such as Amazon VPC itself) and selecting the option to use an IPAM pool for the CIDR, which leads to IPAM automatically creating the allocation for you; or manually, by allocating a CIDR within an IPAM pool to reserve it for later use with an AWS service that's integrated with IPAM. The documentation provides step-by-step guidance on both methods, showing how to use AWS services integrated with IPAM to provision an IPAM pool CIDR, and also how to manually reserve IP address space."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/prov-cidr-ipam.html,How does one provision CIDRs to a pool in Amazon VPC IP Address Manager and what notable limits should be considered?,"To provision CIDRs to a pool in Amazon VPC's IP Address Manager (IPAM), you must navigate to the IPAM console, select 'Pools', choose the appropriate pool, and then select 'Actions' > 'Provision CIDRs'. It's important to input the CIDR you want to add and be aware that by default, only one Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block can be added to a regional poolany increase to this limit requires a change to the account's quotas. Additionally, the CIDR must be available within the selected scope or pool. When the process is complete, the provisioned CIDR can be viewed under the CIDRs tab for the selected pool. For command line users, AWS CLI commands such as 'describe-ipam-pools', 'get-ipam-pool-cidrs', and 'provision-ipam-pool-cidr' are available to manage CIDRs in a pool."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/res-disc-work-with.html,"What is a resource discovery in the context of Amazon VPC IP Address Manager, and how does it function within AWS accounts and organizations?","A resource discovery is a component of the Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) that enables IPAM to manage and monitor resources within the owning account. It is automatically created when a new IPAM is set up, but can also be independently established and then integrated with an IPAM of a different account or organization. This functionality is particularly significant for organizations, as a resource discovery owned by the delegated administrator will monitor resources for all its members. Resource discoveries facilitate the integration of IPAM with accounts outside of your organization, playing a crucial role in the cross-account management of IP resources."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/res-disc-work-with-disassociate.html,How do you disassociate a non-default resource discovery from an IPAM in AWS?,"To disassociate a resource discovery from an IPAM in Amazon VPC, you must access the IPAM console, select 'IPAMs' from the navigation pane, then 'Associated discoveries', and choose 'Disassociate resource discoveries'. You then choose the specific resource discovery that was shared with you by the Secondary Org Admin Account and select 'Disassociate' to complete the process. It is important to note that this action can only be performed by the Primary Org IPAM Account, and the default resource discovery association that is created automatically when the IPAM is set up, cannot be disassociated but will be deleted if the IPAM itself is deleted."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/release-alloc-ipam.html,How do you release an allocation from an IPAM pool in Amazon VPC?,"To release an allocation from an IPAM pool in Amazon VPC, you must first release the CIDR allocation from the resource or another IPAM pool it is assigned to, as you cannot delete pools with provisioned CIDRs. The process for releasing an allocation differs depending on whether the scope is private or public. For a private scope, you must ignore or delete the resource CIDR and Amazon VPC IPAM will automatically release the allocation after some time. To release an allocation in a public scope, you must delete the resource CIDR since public resource CIDRs cannot be ignored. All account permissions should be configured correctly for the release to be completed by Amazon VPC IPAM, which will then recycle the CIDR back into the pool and make it available for future allocations after a short period. Detailed instructions for releasing a pool allocation through AWS Management Console or AWS CLI are provided on the webpage, including steps like selecting the relevant pool and choosing the 'Release custom allocation' option, and using specific CLI commands for different actions."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/monitor-cidr-usage-ipam.html,How can users monitor CIDR usage in Amazon VPC using the IPAM dashboard?,"Users can monitor CIDR usage in Amazon VPC using the IP Address Manager (IPAM) dashboard by accessing the IPAM console, selecting the Dashboard from the navigation pane, and choosing the desired scope from the dropdown menu. The dashboard provides an overview of the IPAM pools and CIDRs within a scope, including details on scope type and ID, the number of various types of resource CIDRs such as subnets, VPCs, and Elastic IP addresses, as well as management states like unmanaged, ignored, and managed CIDRs. Additionally, it displays overlapping and nonoverlapping CIDRs which affects routing in VPCs, and compliance status of resource CIDRs based on allocation rules. Utilization metrics for VPCs and subnets can be used to set up alerts, while also indicating pool assignment and allocation percentages over time. This helps users to manage and assess their IP space efficiently, identify if additional CIDR provisioning is required and ensure compliance with IPAM rules."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/tutorials-get-started-console.html,"What are the steps involved in creating an IPAM and associated pools in Amazon VPC, and how do AWS Organizations integrate in this process?","In Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), creating an IP Address Manager (IPAM) involves a sequence of steps that include delegating an IPAM administrator, creating IPAM, setting up top-level and regional IPAM pools, and integrating with AWS Organizations to manage IP addresses across accounts. The tutorial covers how to delegate an IPAM admin, create an IPAM with private and public scopes, create hierarchical pools beginning with a top-level IPAM pool and followed by regional and specific development pools for pre-production resources. It also involves sharing the IPAM pool with other member accounts using AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM), creating a VPC with a CIDR allocated from an IPAM pool, and cleaning up the resources afterward. Throughout the process, AWS Organizations plays a key role by allowing the management of IP addresses across accounts within the organization, except for accounts outside of your own organization. The integration involves using a management account to log into the IPAM console and delegate an IPAM admin, a member account to act as the IPAM admin for creating and managing the IPAM, and another member account as a developer account to create a VPC with a CIDR from the shared IPAM pool."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/tutorials-byoip-ipam-console-ipv4.html,How can an AWS user bring their own IPv4 CIDR to AWS IP Address Manager and allocate an Elastic IP address using AWS Management Console and CLI?,"To bring their own IPv4 CIDR to AWS IP Address Manager (IPAM) and allocate an Elastic IP address (EIP), users should follow a specific set of steps using the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI. It involves creating named AWS CLI profiles and IAM roles, setting up a top-level IPAM pool, creating a Regional pool within the top-level pool, and sharing the Regional pool. Subsequently, they will create a public IPv4 pool, provision their IPv4 CIDR to the public pool, and create an EIP from this public IPv4 pool. After creating the EIP, they need to associate it with an EC2 instance and advertise the CIDR for the BYOIP CIDR to be publicly accessible over the internet. Finally, when the tasks are completed or for cleanup, instructions are provided to reverse the process, like withdrawing the CIDR advert, disassociating and releasing the EIP, deprovisioning the IPv4 CIDR from the public pool, and deleting the public IPv4 pool as well as the IPAM pools. Throughout this process, users deal with distinct resources in AWS for managing public IPv4 pools and IPAM pools, and they must ensure the correct AWS CLI profile is used for the corresponding IAM role and account actions."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/iam-ipam-policy-examples.html,What actions are included in the example policy for full IPAM usage as per the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) documentation?,"The example policy provided in the AWS IAM documentation for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) IP Address Manager (IPAM) contains a comprehensive list of actions that are necessary for full usage of IPAM. These actions include tasks for associating, deprovisioning, describing, and disassociating IP blocks in the context of Bring Your Own ASN (BYOASN), as well as creating, modifying, and deleting IPAMs, IPAM scopes, and IPAM pools. Additional actions entail provisioning and deprovisioning pool CIDRs, allocating and releasing pool CIDRs, and managing IPAM resource discovery, among others. The policy also allows for the creation of service-linked roles with specific conditions. The provided actions reflect a broad range of permissions that cater to the various aspects of managing IPAM within an AWS environment."

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-manager/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-vpc-attachment.html,How does one attach a VPC to a core network edge in AWS Cloud WAN and what are some key considerations?,"To attach a VPC to a core network edge in AWS Cloud WAN, you must specify one subnet from each Availability Zone that the core network edge will use to route traffic, enabling communication with resources in all subnets within that Availability Zone. It's important to note that subnets from Local Zones cannot be used for this purpose, as selecting one will result in an error. Additionally, when creating a Cloud WAN VPC attachment, one must also account for IPv4 support, since IPv6-only subnets are not permitted for a core network VPC attachment. If an appliance mode is required for a stateful network appliance, it can be enabled during the creation of the attachment, ensuring consistent Availability Zone usage for the flow's duration. This appliance mode supports traffic flow across different AWS Regions and can handle network flows entering from various attachment types like VPN or Connect attachments. The VPC attachment can be created via AWS Management Console or command line/API, and shared VPC subnets can only be attached by the VPC owner, not participants."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-manager/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-register-tgw.html,How do you register a transit gateway with AWS Cloud WAN?,"To register a transit gateway in AWS Cloud WAN, you must access the Network Manager console at the provided URL and navigate to the 'Connectivity' section where you will choose 'Global Networks'. You then select your global network ID and click on 'Transit gateways'. From there, you'll be able to select the transit gateway you want to register and then click 'Register Transit Gateway'. This assumes you have already created a transit gateway in Amazon VPC, which is a prerequisite."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-manager/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-policy-examples-one-segment-region.html,What is the purpose of the policy example in the AWS Network Manager User Guide for setting up a network in the us-east-1 region?,"The policy example in the AWS Network Manager User Guide is designed to set up a network named 'my-network' in the AWS region us-east-1. The setup allows any attachment to be automatically added to the network without the need for approval. This is facilitated by a set of configurations that define the Autonomous System Number (ASN) ranges and specify that 'my-network' does not require attachment acceptance. Additionally, the policy includes attachment rules with conditions and actions that further facilitate this automatic association of attachments to the network segment."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-manager/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-tags.html,What is the function and process of using tags in AWS Cloud WAN's core network?,"A tag in AWS Cloud WAN is a metadata label that you or AWS can assign to an AWS resource, composed of a key and a value, such as ""purpose"" and ""test."" Tags are crucial for identifying and organizing AWS resources, as they can be used across various services to show resource relationships. Moreover, tags can help control access to AWS resources. In the context of a core network, tags simplify the association of attachments to network segments through attachment policies. Instead of manual association, tags enable automated mapping to the specified segments as per the policies. For instance, an attachment with a tag indicating ""segment"":""development"" would automatically be associated with a development segment. AWS Network Manager console provides a user-friendly interface to add, update, or remove these tags, streamlining network management and enhancing security and organization."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-manager/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-security.html,How does AWS Cloud WAN use IAM to control access to its resources?,"AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an essential service for managing access to AWS Cloud WAN resources. IAM enables administrators to securely control who is authenticated and authorized to use those resources. By default, IAM users lack permissions to create, view, or modify resources, but administrators can set up IAM policies to grant specific permissions to users or groups. These policies dictate which resources users can access and the actions they can perform, thus ensuring secure and controlled access management for AWS Cloud WAN. Additionally, IAM supports the use of condition keys and tags to refine access control further, allowing permissions to be customized based on various conditions such as resource tags or specific AWS resource names (ARNs)."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-manager/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-quotas.html,What is the default and adjustable status of the bandwidth per VPC attachment per Availability Zone for AWS Cloud WAN?,"The default bandwidth per VPC attachment per Availability Zone for AWS Cloud WAN is up to 100 Gbps. These quotas are adjustable; but rather than directly changing them through a service console, customers need to contact their Solutions Architect (SA) or Technical Account Manager (TAM) for further assistance to potentially increase these quota limits."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/reachability/identity-access-management.html,"What is AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and how does it relate to the use of the Reachability Analyzer in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?","AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services that assists administrators in securely controlling access to AWS resources. IAM enables administrators to manage who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use Reachability Analyzer resources within Amazon VPC. Reachability Analyzer users may include service users, service administrators, and IAM administrators, each with different IAM-related responsibilities and needs. Service users rely on their administrators to provide appropriate credentials and permissions; service administrators determine which features and resources users should access and request changes in permissions as needed; IAM administrators handle the specific policy-writing that governs access to Reachability Analyzer. The IAM service comes with no additional charge, and understanding its functions is crucial for efficiently managing access to AWS services, including the Reachability Analyzer."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/reachability/using-service-linked-roles.html,What is the purpose of using a service-linked role with Reachability Analyzer in AWS?,"A service-linked role for the Reachability Analyzer in AWS simplifies the setup process by automatically providing the necessary permissions for Reachability Analyzer to perform multi-account analysis and to call other AWS services on the users behalf. The role, AWSServiceRoleForReachabilityAnalyzer, is predefined by Reachability Analyzer and comes with a specific set of permissions that cannot be modified or attached to any other IAM entity. Additionally, this role integrates with AWS Organizations to facilitate account analysis without requiring users to manually create or define permissions."
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/reachability/cross-account-access-roles.html,How does Reachability Analyzer facilitate cross-account resource access for path analyses in AWS organizations?,"When you enable trusted access for Reachability Analyzer in an AWS organization, AWS CloudFormation StackSets deploys the IAMRoleForReachabilityAnalyzerCrossAccountResourceAccess IAM role across all member accounts in the organization. This role is custom-created automatically and grants the management account and delegated administrator accounts the ability to specify resources from these member accounts for path analyses. The console is strongly recommended for enabling trusted access, as it lessens the likelihood of errors compared to alternative methods. The role allows read-only access through role switching and includes managed policies for AWSDirectConnectReadOnlyAccess, AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess, and AmazonVPCReachabilityAnalyzerPathComponentReadPolicy. Turning off trusted access results in the removal of the StackSets, while deregistering a delegated administrator prevents it from assuming this custom IAM role."
