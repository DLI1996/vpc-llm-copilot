The AWS CreateFlowLogs API allows users to create flow logs to capture information about IP traffic for a specific network interface, subnet, or VPC. The flow log data is recorded as flow log records, which are log events that describe the traffic flow. The flow log records can be published to CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3. The API provides various request parameters and returns the IDs of the created flow logs. Examples are provided for different scenarios.
