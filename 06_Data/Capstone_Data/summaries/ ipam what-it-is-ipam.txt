Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) is a feature that helps users plan, track, and monitor IP addresses for their AWS workloads. It allows for the organization of IP address space, monitoring of IP address usage, and troubleshooting network connectivity issues. IPAM also enables the sharing of Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) addresses and the provision of IPv6 CIDR blocks. The documentation provides detailed information on how IPAM works and includes step-by-step tutorials for its use.
