This documentation provides information about the Matcher data type in Amazon VPC Lattice API. The Matcher data type is a UNION, meaning only one of its members can be specified. It includes the httpCode member, which represents the HTTP code to use when checking for a successful response from a target. The httpCode member is a string with length constraints and a specific pattern. The documentation also provides links to language-specific AWS SDKs for more information on using this API.
