The AWS API Reference for the DescribeNetworkInterfaces action provides information on how to describe one or more network interfaces. It includes details on the request parameters, response elements, errors, and examples. The action allows you to filter the results based on various criteria such as association ID, private IP address, attachment status, and more. The maximum number of items to return can be specified using the MaxResults parameter. The response includes information about the network interfaces, a token for pagination, and the request ID. The API can be used with various AWS SDKs and command-line interfaces.
