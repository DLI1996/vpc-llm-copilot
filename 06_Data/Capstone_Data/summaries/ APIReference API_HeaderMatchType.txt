This is a summary of the documentation for the AWS Amazon VPC Lattice API Reference. It describes the HeaderMatchType data type, which is a union type with three possible members: contains, exact, and prefix. Each member represents a different type of header match. The length constraints for the string values of these members are a minimum length of 1 and a maximum length of 200. The documentation also provides links to language-specific AWS SDKs for more information on using this API.
