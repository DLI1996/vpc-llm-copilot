The AWS PutResourcePolicy API allows users to create or update a resource policy. The request must include the ARN of the resource policy and the JSON resource policy document. If the action is successful, the service will send back an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body. Possible errors include AccessDeniedException, ConflictException, InternalServerException, ServiceQuotaExceededException, ThrottlingException, and ValidationException. This API can be used with various AWS SDKs and requires JavaScript to be enabled in the browser.
