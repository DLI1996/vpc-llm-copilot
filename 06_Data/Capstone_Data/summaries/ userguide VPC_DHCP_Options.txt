This documentation explains the concept of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) in Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). DHCP is used by network devices in a VPC to assign IP addresses and other network configuration information. Amazon DHCP servers can provide IPv4 or IPv6 addresses and additional network configurations through DHCP option sets. The documentation also mentions that EC2 instances in dual-stack subnets can only retrieve their IPv6 address from the IPv6 DHCP server, while instances in IPv6-only subnets can retrieve additional networking configuration information.
