AWS PrivateLink publishes data points to Amazon CloudWatch for interface endpoints, Gateway Load Balancer endpoints, and endpoint services. CloudWatch metrics, such as ActiveConnections, BytesProcessed, NewConnections, PacketsDropped, and RstPacketsReceived, can be used to monitor and verify the performance of these endpoints and services. Metrics can be filtered using dimensions such as Endpoint Type, Service Name, Subnet Id, VPC Endpoint Id, and VPC Id. CloudWatch metrics can be viewed using the Amazon VPC console, CloudWatch console, or AWS CLI. AWS PrivateLink also provides built-in Contributor Insights rules to identify the largest contributors to each metric. These rules can be enabled, disabled, or deleted using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
