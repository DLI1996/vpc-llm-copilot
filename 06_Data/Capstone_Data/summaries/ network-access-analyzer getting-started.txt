AWS Network Access Analyzer is a tool that allows users to analyze network access to resources in their virtual private clouds (VPCs). Users can start by analyzing their network using one of the Amazon created Network Access Scopes, which identify network paths within the account and Region. After the analysis is complete, users can review the findings, including the network paths and configurations that produced them. Users can also create their own Network Access Scopes based on common network access scenarios or using an empty template. Additionally, users have the option to duplicate or delete Network Access Scopes.
