This document provides an example of a three-stage development environment using AWS Network Manager and AWS Cloud WAN. The policy creates a software development lifecycle policy with development, testing, and production stages. VPCs in each segment are isolated and tagged with their stage. Development and testing stages are automatically mapped, while production requires approval. There is also a shared services segment with a VPC and site-to-site VPN, which is mapped by resource ID. The shared services segment allows communication between the isolated development environments and on-premises through the VPN.
