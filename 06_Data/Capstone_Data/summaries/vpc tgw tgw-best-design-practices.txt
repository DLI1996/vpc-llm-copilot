This document provides best practices for designing a transit gateway in Amazon VPC. It recommends using separate subnets for each transit gateway VPC attachment, keeping network ACLs open, using BGP Site-to-Site VPN connections, enabling route propagation, and considering migration from VPC peering. It also suggests limiting the number of transit gateway route tables and using a single transit gateway for redundancy. Additionally, it mentions using a unique ASN for each transit gateway and inter-Region peering for deployments with multiple transit gateways.
