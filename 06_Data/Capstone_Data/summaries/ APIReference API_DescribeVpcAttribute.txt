The DescribeVpcAttribute API allows you to retrieve information about a specific attribute of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in Amazon EC2. You can specify the attribute you want to retrieve, such as enableDnsSupport or enableDnsHostnames. The API provides response elements that indicate whether DNS resolution and DNS hostnames are enabled for the VPC. The API also supports error handling and provides examples for reference.
