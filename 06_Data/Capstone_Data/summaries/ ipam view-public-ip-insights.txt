The AWS Documentation provides information about Amazon VPC and the IP Address Manager. It explains that a public IPv4 address is necessary for a resource to be directly reachable from the internet over IPv4 and that public IPv4 addresses are charged. The documentation also describes the different types of public IPv4 addresses, including Elastic IP addresses, EC2 public IPv4 addresses, BYOIPv4 addresses, and service-managed IPv4 addresses. It provides insights into the usage of these public IPv4 address types and allows users to view details and history of public IP addresses. The documentation also mentions that public IPv4 insights cannot be viewed using the AWS CLI.
