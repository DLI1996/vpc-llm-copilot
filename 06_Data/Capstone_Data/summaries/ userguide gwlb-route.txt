The AWS documentation provides information on how to inspect traffic in a VPC using security appliances. The middlebox routing wizard automatically creates and configures route tables for the internet gateway, application subnet, and provider subnet. It also adds necessary routes and associates the new route tables with the corresponding resources. The route tables have specific routes for routing traffic to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint for inspection. The middlebox routing wizard adds tags to the route tables indicating its origin and creation date. If the wizard is not used, manual configuration and assignment of route tables is required. The documentation also includes information on inspecting traffic between subnets and provides document conventions for using the AWS documentation.
