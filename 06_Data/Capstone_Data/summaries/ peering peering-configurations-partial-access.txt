This document provides information about VPC peering configurations in AWS. It explains how to configure route tables for VPC peering connections to restrict access to specific subnets, CIDR blocks, or resources in the peer VPC. It also provides examples of different VPC peering scenarios and how to update route tables for VPC peering connections. The document includes multiple VPC configurations, including scenarios where two VPCs access specific subnets or CIDR blocks in one VPC, one VPC accesses specific subnets in two VPCs, instances in one VPC access specific instances in two VPCs, and one VPC accesses two VPCs using longest prefix matches. It also discusses routing for response traffic and provides guidance on how to prevent routing issues in VPC peering connections.
