This section of the AWS documentation explains how to associate a resource discovery with an IP Address Manager (IPAM). When a resource discovery is associated with an IPAM, the IPAM monitors all resources CIDRs and accounts discovered under the resource discovery. By default, a resource discovery is automatically associated with an IPAM when it is created. The default quota for resource discovery associations is 5, but this can be adjusted. This process is part of integrating IPAM with accounts outside of your organization. The steps to associate a resource discovery are provided in the documentation.
