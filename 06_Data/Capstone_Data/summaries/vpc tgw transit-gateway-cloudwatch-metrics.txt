Amazon VPC publishes data points to Amazon CloudWatch for your transit gateways and transit gateway attachments. CloudWatch allows you to retrieve statistics about these data points as metrics. These metrics can be used to monitor the performance of your system and create alarms to initiate actions if the metrics go outside an acceptable range. The AWS/TransitGateway namespace includes metrics such as BytesIn, BytesOut, PacketsIn, and PacketsOut. There are also attachment-level metrics available for transit gateway attachments. To filter the metrics, you can use dimensions such as TransitGateway and TransitGatewayAttachment.
