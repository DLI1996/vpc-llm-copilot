This documentation is about the AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways API, specifically the TagResource operation. It provides information on the request syntax, URI request parameters, request body, response syntax, response elements, and errors. The TagResource operation allows users to tag a specified resource by providing the resource's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and the tags to apply. The response is an HTTP 200 response with an empty body if the action is successful. The documentation also provides links to additional resources and SDKs for using the API in different programming languages.
