The AWS CreateTrafficMirrorSession API allows users to create a Traffic Mirror session, which actively copies packets from a Traffic Mirror source to a Traffic Mirror target. Users can create a filter to define a subset of the traffic to mirror. The source and target can be in the same VPC or in different VPCs connected via VPC peering or a transit gateway. The API provides various request parameters, such as ClientToken, Description, DryRun, NetworkInterfaceId, PacketLength, SessionNumber, TagSpecification, TrafficMirrorFilterId, and TrafficMirrorTargetId. The response includes elements like clientToken, requestId, and trafficMirrorSession.
