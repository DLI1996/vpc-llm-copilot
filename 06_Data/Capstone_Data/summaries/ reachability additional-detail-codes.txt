The Reachability Analyzer in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) uses additional detail codes to provide information about the result of a path analysis. These codes include assumptions about target group attributes, crossing availability zones, unsupported firewall rule types or options, missing routes, recommended appliance mode, and unidirectional path analysis. These codes help users verify assumptions and ensure the behavior of AWS Network Firewall matches their network.
