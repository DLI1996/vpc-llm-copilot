This document provides information on how to work with resource discoveries in Amazon VPC's IP Address Manager (IPAM). A resource discovery is a component that allows IPAM to manage and monitor resources within an account. It can be created independently or automatically when creating an IPAM. The document outlines the steps to create, view, share, associate, disassociate, and delete a resource discovery. It also mentions that these actions are only necessary when integrating IPAM with accounts outside of the organization.
