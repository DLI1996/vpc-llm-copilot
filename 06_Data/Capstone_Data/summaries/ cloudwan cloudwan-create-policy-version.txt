The AWS Network Manager allows users to create policy versions for their core network. These policy versions can be created using either the AWS Cloud WAN console or by creating a JSON file. When creating a policy version, users can configure settings that determine how their network works. The policy version ID increments from the previous live version, and the latest version is displayed as "LATEST" on the Policy versions screen. Change set states can be "Ready to execute," "Execution succeeded," "Out of date," "Failed generation," or "Pending generation." Users can create a core network policy version by configuring network settings, creating network policy segments, creating segment sharing and segment route actions, and creating policy attachments. Alternatively, they can create a policy version using the JSON editor by adding the parameters of their core network and policies.
