This documentation provides an overview of AWS PrivateLink and gateway endpoints in Amazon VPC. Gateway endpoints allow connectivity to Amazon S3 and DynamoDB without the need for an internet gateway or NAT device. The documentation explains the routing and considerations for using gateway endpoints, including how to configure route tables and the precedence of routes. It also mentions that Amazon S3 supports both gateway endpoints and interface endpoints.
