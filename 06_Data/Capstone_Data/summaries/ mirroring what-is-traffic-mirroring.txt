Traffic Mirroring is a feature of Amazon VPC that allows you to copy network traffic from a network interface and send it to security and monitoring appliances for content inspection, threat monitoring, and troubleshooting. It supports filters and packet truncation to extract only the traffic of interest. You can create, access, and manage traffic mirror resources using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or Query API. Traffic Mirroring offers benefits such as simplified operation, enhanced security, and increased monitoring options. Pricing is based on an hourly basis for each active traffic mirror session.
