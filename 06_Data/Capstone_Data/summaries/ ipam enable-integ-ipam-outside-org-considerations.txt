This section discusses considerations and limitations for integrating IP Address Manager (IPAM) with accounts outside of your organization in Amazon VPC. When sharing a resource discovery with another account, only IP address and account status monitoring data is exchanged. No organization data is shared. If the owner account is a third-party service AWS account that creates resources for multiple customers, those resources will be discovered by the resource discovery. Caution should be exercised when creating and sharing resource discoveries or using a separate AWS account for each customer.
