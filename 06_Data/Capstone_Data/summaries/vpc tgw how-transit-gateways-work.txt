AWS Transit Gateway is a regional virtual router that allows traffic to flow between virtual private clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks. It scales elastically based on network traffic volume and operates at layer 3 routing. Transit Gateway supports resource attachments such as VPCs, VPN connections, Direct Connect gateways, Transit Gateway Connect attachments, and transit gateway peering connections. It also supports Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) routing for most attachments, except VPC attachments. Availability Zones must be enabled for routing traffic to resources in VPC subnets. Transit Gateway routes packets between attachments using transit gateway route tables, which can be associated with multiple attachments and can propagate routes from attached VPCs, VPN connections, and Direct Connect gateways. Transit Gateway routes are evaluated based on the most specific route for the destination address and the route priority.
