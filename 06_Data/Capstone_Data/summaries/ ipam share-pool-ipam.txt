This documentation explains how to share an IP Address Manager (IPAM) pool using AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM). By sharing the IPAM pool, other AWS accounts, IAM roles, or organizational units can allocate CIDRs from the pool to their AWS resources. The documentation provides step-by-step instructions on how to share the IPAM pool using RAM and the necessary permissions and configurations required. It also mentions that RAM sharing is only available in the home AWS Region of the IPAM and provides additional resources for monitoring and creating VPCs using the shared IPAM pool.
