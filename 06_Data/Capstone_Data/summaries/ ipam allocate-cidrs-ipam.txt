This documentation explains how to allocate CIDRs from an IP Address Manager (IPAM) pool to resources in Amazon VPC. It provides two methods for allocating CIDRs: using an AWS service integrated with IPAM, such as Amazon VPC, or manually allocating a CIDR within an IPAM pool. The documentation also includes instructions for creating a VPC that uses an IPAM pool CIDR and creating a development IPv6 pool.
