The AWS API Reference provides documentation for the ReplaceRoute action in Amazon EC2. This action allows users to replace an existing route within a route table in a VPC. The action requires specifying a destination CIDR block or a prefix list ID, as well as one of the resources from the parameter list. The documentation includes information on the request parameters, response elements, errors, and examples. It also provides links to related resources and language-specific AWS SDKs.
