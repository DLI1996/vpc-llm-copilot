AWS allows users to share multicast domains with other AWS accounts within their organization or across organizations in AWS Organizations. As the owner of a multicast domain, users can create and manage the domain centrally, while consumers can perform operations such as registering and deregistering group members or sources, and associating or disassociating subnets with the multicast domain. Multicast domains can be shared with AWS accounts inside or outside of AWS Organizations, and sharing can be done through the Amazon VPC console, AWS RAM console, or AWS CLI. Unsharing a shared multicast domain disassociates subnets and deletes group sources and members from the consumer account. Owners and consumers can identify shared multicast domains using the Amazon VPC console or AWS CLI. Owners have permissions to manage the multicast domain and its resources, while consumers have permissions to manage the resources they create on the shared multicast domain. Sharing multicast domains does not incur additional charges, and shared multicast domains count towards the owner's and consumer's multicast domain quotas.
