This document provides instructions on how to integrate IP Address Manager (IPAM) with AWS Organizations and delegate an IPAM admin account. By integrating IPAM with AWS Organizations, you can share IPAM pools with your organization and monitor IP address usage across all accounts. It is important to enable integration with AWS Organizations using IPAM in the AWS management console or the AWS CLI command. The IPAM account must be an AWS Organizations member account and must have the necessary IAM role and policy attached to it. The document also provides steps on how to select an IPAM account and delegate an IPAM admin account using the AWS CLI. Once the IPAM admin account is delegated, IPAM automatically creates a service-linked IAM role in all member accounts and monitors the IP address usage in these accounts.
