The AWS ModifyVpcEndpointServicePermissions API allows users to modify the permissions for their VPC endpoint service. Users can add or remove permissions for service consumers to connect to the endpoint service. The API provides request parameters such as AddAllowedPrincipals, DryRun, RemoveAllowedPrincipals, and ServiceId. The response elements include addedPrincipalSet, requestId, and return. The API also provides examples and references to other AWS SDKs for further information.
