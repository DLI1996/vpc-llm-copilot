This documentation provides instructions on how to delete a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) in AWS (Amazon Web Services). Before deleting a VPC, it is necessary to terminate or delete any resources that were created within the VPC, such as EC2 instances, load balancers, NAT gateways, transit gateway VPC attachments, and interface VPC endpoints. The documentation provides step-by-step instructions on how to delete a VPC using both the AWS Management Console and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). It also includes commands for deleting various VPC resources before deleting the VPC itself.
