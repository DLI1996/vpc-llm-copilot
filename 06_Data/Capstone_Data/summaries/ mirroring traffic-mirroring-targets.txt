This document provides information about AWS Traffic Mirroring, a feature that allows you to capture and inspect network traffic in your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It explains the concept of traffic mirror targets, which are the destinations for mirrored traffic. The document describes different types of traffic mirror targets, including network interfaces, Network Load Balancers, and Gateway Load Balancer endpoints. It also provides considerations and recommendations for using these targets, such as enabling cross-zone load balancing for Network Load Balancers and configuring security groups and route tables. Additionally, the document discusses VXLAN encapsulation, routing and security group configurations, and options for processing mirrored traffic using open-source tools or monitoring solutions from AWS Marketplace.
