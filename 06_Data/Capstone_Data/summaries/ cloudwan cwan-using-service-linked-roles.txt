The AWS Cloud WAN service uses several service-linked roles to call other AWS services on behalf of the user. These roles include AWSServiceRoleForNetworkManagerCloudWAN, AWSServiceRoleForVPCTransitGateway, and AWSServiceRoleForNetworkManager. These roles have specific permissions and trust certain services to assume the roles. The service-linked roles can be created, edited, and deleted using IAM. It is recommended to delete the roles if they are no longer needed. The service-linked roles are supported in all AWS regions where the Network Manager service is available.
