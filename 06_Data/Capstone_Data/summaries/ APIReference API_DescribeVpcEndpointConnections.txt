The AWS API action "DescribeVpcEndpointConnections" is used to retrieve information about the VPC endpoint connections to your VPC endpoint services. It provides details such as the IP address type, service ID, endpoint owner, endpoint state, and endpoint ID. The action supports optional parameters such as "DryRun" to check permissions, "Filter.N" to filter the results, "MaxResults" to limit the number of results, and "NextToken" to retrieve the next page of results. The response includes the next token, request ID, and information about the VPC endpoint connections. The action is part of the AWS SDKs and CLI, and documentation is available for various programming languages.
