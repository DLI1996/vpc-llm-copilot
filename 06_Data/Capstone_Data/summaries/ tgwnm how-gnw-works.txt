AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways is a service that allows users to create a global network to represent their network infrastructure. Users can register their existing transit gateways and define their on-premises resources in the global network. The service provides a dashboard for visualizing and monitoring AWS resources and on-premises networks. It supports various resource types such as VPCs, VPN connections, Direct Connect gateways, and more. Users can also create multi-region and multi-account networks. The service does not create, modify, or delete transit gateways and their attachments, but users can manage them through the Amazon VPC console and Amazon EC2 APIs.
