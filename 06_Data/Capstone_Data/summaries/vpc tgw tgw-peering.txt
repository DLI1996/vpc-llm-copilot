AWS Transit Gateway allows you to peer both intra-Region and inter-Region transit gateways and route traffic between them. To create a peering attachment, you need to specify a transit gateway and the peer transit gateway can be in your account or a different AWS account. After creating a peering attachment request, the owner of the peer transit gateway must accept the request. To route traffic between the transit gateways, you need to add a static route to the transit gateway route table. Transit gateway peering attachments do not support resolving public or private IPv4 DNS host names across VPCs on either side of the attachment. Inter-Region gateway peering uses AES-256 encryption for traffic encryption. You can create, accept, reject, and delete peering attachments using the AWS console or CLI. You can also view and manage your transit gateway peering attachments. Opt-in AWS Region considerations should be taken into account when using transit gateway peering across opt-in Region boundaries.
