This documentation explains the use of service-linked roles in Amazon VPC for working with AWS Transit Gateway. Amazon VPC uses the service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForVPCTransitGateway to perform various actions on your behalf when working with a transit gateway. The role has permissions to call actions such as creating, modifying, and deleting network interfaces, assigning and unassigning IPv6 addresses, etc. The role trusts the transitgateway.amazonaws.com service and uses the managed policy AWSVPCTransitGatewayServiceRolePolicy. The role is automatically created by Amazon VPC when you attach a VPC to a transit gateway. You can edit the role's description and delete it, but deletion is only possible after removing all transit gateway VPC attachments.
