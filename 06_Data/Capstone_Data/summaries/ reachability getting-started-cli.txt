The AWS Reachability Analyzer allows users to determine if a destination resource in their Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is reachable from a source resource. The process involves creating a path, analyzing the path, getting the results of the analysis, and deleting the path if necessary. The analyzer provides detailed information about the components involved in the path and identifies any blocking components. Users can use the AWS CLI to interact with the Reachability Analyzer. The documentation provides examples of creating paths, analyzing paths, and viewing the results of the analysis. It also explains how to delete paths and provides information about explanation codes used in the analysis.
