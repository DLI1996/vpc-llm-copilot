Transit Gateway Flow Logs is a feature in AWS that allows you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from your transit gateways. This data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, or Kinesis Data Firehose. Flow log data is collected separately from network traffic, so it does not impact network performance. You can create and delete flow logs without affecting network performance. Flow log records contain information about the traffic flow, such as source and destination addresses, ports, and protocol. You can customize the format of flow log records and apply tags to organize your flow logs. Flow logs can be deleted, but existing log records are not deleted. Pricing for Transit Gateway Flow Logs includes data ingestion and storage charges.
