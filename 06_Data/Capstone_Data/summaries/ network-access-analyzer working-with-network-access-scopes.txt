AWS Network Access Analyzer allows users to specify network access requirements using Network Access Scopes. These scopes define outbound and inbound traffic patterns, including sources, destinations, paths, and traffic types. Each scope consists of match conditions and exclude conditions. Match conditions define the types of network paths that should be produced as findings, while exclude conditions specify paths that should be excluded from the findings. Resource statements and packet header statements are used to define the network components and traffic types for the match and exclude conditions. The documentation provides examples of different Network Access Scopes and how to use resource groups with Network Access Scopes.
