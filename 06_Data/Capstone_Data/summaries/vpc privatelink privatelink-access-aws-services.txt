AWS PrivateLink allows users to access AWS services securely without the need for an internet gateway. By creating an interface VPC endpoint, users can establish connections between their VPC and AWS services using network interfaces. This allows for private access to AWS services, eliminating the need for public service endpoints. DNS hostnames and resolution are used to communicate with the AWS service through private endpoints. Users can configure their VPC endpoint with multiple subnets in different Availability Zones for high availability and resiliency. AWS services can support IPv6 through private endpoints, even if they do not support IPv6 through public endpoints.
