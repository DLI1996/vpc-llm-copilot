The AWS CreateVpcPeeringConnection API allows users to request a VPC peering connection between two VPCs. The requester VPC must be owned by the user, while the accepter VPC can belong to another AWS account and be in a different region. The request includes parameters such as the owner ID of the accepter VPC, the region code for the accepter VPC, and the tags to assign to the peering connection. The response includes the ID of the request and information about the VPC peering connection. The API also provides examples of how to use it.
