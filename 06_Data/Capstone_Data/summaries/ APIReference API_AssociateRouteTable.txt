The AWS AssociateRouteTable API allows you to associate a subnet, internet gateway, or virtual private gateway with a route table in your VPC. This association determines how traffic from the subnet or gateway is routed. The API returns an association ID, which is needed to disassociate the route table later. The API supports various request parameters and returns response elements such as association ID, association state, and request ID. Examples and related resources are also provided.
