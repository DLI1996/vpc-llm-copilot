The AWS CreateNetworkAclEntry API allows users to create a rule in a network ACL with a specified rule number. Each network ACL has separate sets of ingress and egress rules, and the rules are processed in ascending order based on their rule numbers. The API provides parameters such as CidrBlock, DryRun, Egress, Icmp, Ipv6CidrBlock, NetworkAclId, PortRange, Protocol, RuleAction, and RuleNumber. The response includes the requestId and return elements. The API supports various programming languages and SDKs.
