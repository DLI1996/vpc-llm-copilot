This documentation provides instructions on how to bring your own public IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR to IPAM (IP Address Manager) using both the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI. It includes steps to authorize Amazon to advertise your IP address range, create a ROA (Route Origin Authorization) object in your RIR (Regional Internet Registry), and create a certificate for Amazon verification purposes. The maximum length of an IP address prefix for IPv4 CIDRs must be /24, while for IPv6 CIDRs it must be /48. This allows for flexibility in dividing and distributing your public IP address across AWS Regions.
