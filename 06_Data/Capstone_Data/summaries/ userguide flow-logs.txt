AWS VPC Flow Logs is a feature that allows you to capture information about the IP traffic in your VPC. Flow log data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. Flow logs can help with tasks such as diagnosing security group rules, monitoring traffic to instances, and determining traffic direction. Flow log records include information about the traffic flow, such as source and destination addresses, ports, protocol, and more. Flow logs have limitations, such as not capturing all IP traffic. Pricing for flow logs depends on data ingestion and archival charges.
