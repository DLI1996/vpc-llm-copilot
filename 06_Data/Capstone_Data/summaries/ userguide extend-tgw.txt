This documentation from AWS provides information on how to connect your virtual private clouds (VPC) and on-premises networks using a transit gateway. The transit gateway acts as a central hub, routing traffic between VPCs, VPN connections, and AWS Direct Connect connections. The documentation describes different use cases for transit gateways, such as configuring it as a centralized router or multiple isolated routers. It also provides links to more information on each use case.
