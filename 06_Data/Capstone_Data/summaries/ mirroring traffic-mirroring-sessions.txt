This document provides information about AWS Traffic Mirroring, specifically focusing on traffic mirror sessions and traffic mirror sources. A traffic mirror session establishes a relationship between a source and a target, and each session contains a source, target, and filter. Multiple sessions can be used on the same source to send different subsets of mirrored traffic to different tools. The document also lists the instance types on which Traffic Mirroring is not available and provides information on enabling JavaScript for accessing the AWS Documentation.
