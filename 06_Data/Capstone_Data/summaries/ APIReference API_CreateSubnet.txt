The AWS CreateSubnet API allows users to create a subnet in a specified VPC. Users can specify the IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR block for the subnet, and the API ensures that the CIDR block does not overlap with existing subnets in the VPC. The API also provides options for creating IPv6-only subnets or dual stack subnets. The response includes the ID of the created subnet. The API supports various request parameters and provides examples for different use cases.
