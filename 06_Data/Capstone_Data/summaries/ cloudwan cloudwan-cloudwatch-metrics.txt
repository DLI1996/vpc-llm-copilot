The AWS Network Manager allows users to monitor their core network and core network attachments using Amazon CloudWatch metrics. These metrics provide real-time data on network performance and can be accessed through the Network Manager console. Users can set alarms to monitor specific thresholds and receive notifications or take actions when those thresholds are met. The metrics available include bytes in, bytes out, bytes dropped, packets in, and packets out. However, CloudWatch metrics in the AWS/NetworkManager namespace are only available in certain regions.
