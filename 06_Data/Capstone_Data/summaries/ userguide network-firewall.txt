AWS Network Firewall is a stateful, managed network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention service that allows users to filter network traffic at the perimeter of their Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It can be implemented using resources such as firewalls, firewall policies, and rule groups. Users can also use AWS Firewall Manager to centrally configure and manage Network Firewall resources across multiple accounts and applications.
