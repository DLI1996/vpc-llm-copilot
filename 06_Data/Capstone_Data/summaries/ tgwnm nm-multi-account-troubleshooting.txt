The AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways User Guide provides documentation on how to troubleshoot self-managed role deployments for AWS Network Manager. It explains that AWS CloudFormation StackSets is used to deploy the required IAM roles for cross-account access. The guide recommends using the global networks console for enabling multi-account settings, as it automatically sets up all required roles and permissions. If an IAM role already exists with the same name in a member account, it can be changed from self-managed to StackSets-managed by deleting the duplicate role and retrying the role deployment through the global networks console.
