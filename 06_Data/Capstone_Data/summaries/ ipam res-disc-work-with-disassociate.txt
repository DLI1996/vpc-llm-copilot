This section of the AWS documentation explains how to disassociate a resource discovery from an IP Address Manager (IPAM). Disassociating a resource discovery means that the IPAM will no longer monitor the resources CIDRs and accounts discovered under that resource discovery. However, it is not possible to disassociate a default resource discovery association. The process of disassociating a resource discovery must be completed by the Primary Org IPAM Account. The documentation provides step-by-step instructions on how to disassociate a resource discovery using the IPAM console. It also includes a link to the AWS CLI Reference documentation for more detailed information on the commands used in the process.
