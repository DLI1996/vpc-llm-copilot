This section of the AWS documentation explains how to create a resource discovery in Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM). A resource discovery is automatically created when an IPAM is created, and it allows for integration with accounts outside of your organization. The process of creating a resource discovery is a required step for integrating an IPAM with external accounts. The documentation provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a resource discovery using the IPAM console. It also mentions that the resource discovery should have the same operating regions as the IPAM to ensure resource discovery in those regions. The documentation includes a link to the AWS CLI Reference documentation for more detailed information on the commands related to resource discoveries.
