The AWS CreateNatGateway API allows users to create a NAT gateway in a specified subnet. This can be either a public NAT gateway, which allows internet-bound traffic from a private subnet to connect to the internet, or a private NAT gateway, which routes private communication across VPCs and on-premises networks. The API provides various request parameters, such as allocation ID, client token, connectivity type, private IP address, and more. The response includes information about the NAT gateway, such as the client token, NAT gateway details, and request ID. The API also provides examples and references to other AWS SDKs for further information.
