This documentation provides information about the AWS Reachability Analyzer and the IAMRoleForReachabilityAnalyzerCrossAccountResourceAccess IAM role. When trusted access is enabled for Reachability Analyzer, the IAM role is deployed to all member accounts in the organization using AWS CloudFormation StackSets. The IAM role allows the management account and delegated administrator accounts to specify resources from member accounts in path analyses. The documentation also explains how to manage IAM role deployments and troubleshoot self-managed role deployments.
