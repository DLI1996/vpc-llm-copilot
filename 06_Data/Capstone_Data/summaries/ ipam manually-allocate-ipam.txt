This documentation explains how to manually allocate a CIDR to a pool in Amazon VPC's IP Address Manager (IPAM). This can be done to reserve IP address space for later use or to represent an on-premises network. The steps to allocate a CIDR are provided, along with AWS CLI commands for creating and viewing the allocation. The documentation also includes information on releasing a manually allocated CIDR and provides links to additional AWS CLI reference documentation.
