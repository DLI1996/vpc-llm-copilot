This summary provides information about Traffic Mirroring in Amazon VPC. Mirrored traffic is encapsulated with a VXLAN header, and the packet format includes fields such as VXLAN ID, source IP address, source port, destination IP address, and destination port. Appliances that receive mirrored traffic through a Gateway Load Balancer should be able to parse both outer GENEVE encapsulation and inner VXLAN encapsulation to retrieve the original L3 packet. For more information, refer to the AWS Documentation.
