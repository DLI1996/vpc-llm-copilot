This documentation provides instructions on how to change the monitoring state of a VPC CIDR in Amazon VPC's IP Address Manager (IPAM). The monitoring state can be changed from monitored to ignored or vice versa. Ignored CIDRs are exempt from monitoring and are not evaluated for overlap with other CIDRs or allocation rule compliance. The documentation also provides steps to change the monitoring status using the IPAM console or AWS CLI commands. Additionally, it mentions that ignored CIDRs are still charged for active IP addresses and their history can still be viewed.
