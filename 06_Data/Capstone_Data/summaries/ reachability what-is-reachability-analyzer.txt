Reachability Analyzer is a configuration analysis tool provided by AWS that allows users to test connectivity between resources in their virtual private clouds (VPCs). It can identify and troubleshoot connectivity issues caused by misconfigurations in security groups, network ACLs, route tables, or load balancers. Users can access Reachability Analyzer through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, AWS CloudFormation, AWS SDKs, or the Query API. Pricing is based on the number of analysis runs between a source and destination.
