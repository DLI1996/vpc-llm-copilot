The AWS Network Manager allows users to create, update, delete, and associate devices within their global network. Devices can represent physical or virtual appliances and can be associated with sites and links. Users can access the Network Manager console or use the AWS CLI to perform these tasks. Device and site associations as well as device and link associations can be managed through the console or CLI.
