This documentation is about the AWS API action "DeleteTransitGatewayConnect". It provides information about the request parameters, response elements, errors, and related resources. The action is used to delete a specified Connect attachment, but it requires deleting any Connect peers for the attachment first. The documentation also includes links to language-specific AWS SDKs and provides instructions on enabling JavaScript to access the Amazon Web Services Documentation.
