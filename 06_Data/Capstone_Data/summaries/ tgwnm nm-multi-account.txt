The AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways User Guide provides documentation on how to enable and manage multi-account access for global network resources using AWS Network Manager. It outlines the prerequisites for enabling multi-account access, such as setting up an account in AWS Organizations, and provides step-by-step instructions for tasks such as enabling trusted access, registering delegated administrators, managing IAM role deployments, deregistering delegated administrators, and disabling trusted access. The guide also includes troubleshooting information for self-managed role deployments.
