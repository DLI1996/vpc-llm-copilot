This is a summary of the documentation for the AWS Amazon VPC Lattice API reference. It describes the constraints for a header match, which is used to match incoming requests based on the request header value before applying a rule action. The documentation provides information about the header match type, the name of the header, and whether the match is case sensitive. It also includes links to language-specific AWS SDKs for more information on using the API.
