AWS Network Access Analyzer is a service that uses automated reasoning algorithms to analyze network paths between resources in an AWS network. It produces findings for paths that match a customer-defined Network Access Scope. The analysis is static and does not involve transmitting packets in the network. The service supports certain types of source and destination resources, as well as specific path resources. However, it does not support all network configurations and has certain limitations. The analysis is limited to IPv4 using UDP or TCP, and it only reports unidirectional analysis. The service has a timeout of 1 hour and 30 minutes, and there are quotas associated with it.
