AWS IP Address Manager (IPAM) publishes IP utilization metrics for resources it monitors, such as VPCs, subnets, and public IPv4 pools. These metrics are calculated separately for IPv4 and IPv6 and are used to determine resource utilization and make decisions about resource management. The metrics are aggregated and published under the same metric name for each resource type. There are limits on the number of metrics that can be published for each resource type, address family, and rule combination. Users can adjust these limits by contacting AWS Support. The documentation provides detailed information on the metric names, dimensions, and how to create alarms based on the metrics.
