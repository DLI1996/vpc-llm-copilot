The GetFlowLogsIntegrationTemplate API in AWS generates a CloudFormation template that automates the integration of VPC flow logs with Amazon Athena. This allows for easier querying and analysis of VPC flow logs data. The API allows you to configure resources in the template to create a table in Athena, update the table with new partitions, and create named queries. The API does not support integration between AWS Transit Gateway Flow Logs and Amazon Athena. The API requires parameters such as the location in Amazon S3 to store the template and the ID of the flow log. The response includes the generated CloudFormation template.
