The AWS Network Manager allows users to view and edit attachments in their core network. This includes Connect attachments, Connect peer attachments, VPC attachments, Site-to-Site VPN attachments, and transit gateway route table attachments. Users can make changes to the configuration and tags of these attachments using the AWS Cloud WAN console, command line, or API. Additionally, users can accept or reject attachment requests and delete attachments from their core network.
