The AWS Network Manager allows users to create a core network within a global network. This can be done either while creating the global network or after it has been created. When creating a core network, users can set up the core network policy and deploy the network structure with the necessary permissions. The core network can then be modified and attachments, transit gateways, and devices can be added. Users can only have one core network per global network. The process of creating a core network involves providing general settings, edge locations, and segment details. The deployment of the core network may take some time, and the status can be viewed in the Policy versions page. Once the core network is created, attachments can be added to it.
