This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to bring your own IPv4 CIDR to IPAM (IP Address Manager) using AWS (Amazon Web Services). It covers creating AWS CLI named profiles and IAM roles, creating IPAM pools, sharing pools, creating a public IPv4 pool, provisioning the CIDR to the pool, creating an Elastic IP address, associating it with an EC2 instance, advertising the CIDR, and cleaning up the resources. The document assumes that certain prerequisites have already been completed and provides instructions for each step using both the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI.
