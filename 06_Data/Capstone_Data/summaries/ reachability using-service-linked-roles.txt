This documentation is about AWS Reachability Analyzer and its use of service-linked roles. Reachability Analyzer uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles for multi-account analysis. These roles are predefined and include all the necessary permissions for the service to call other AWS services on your behalf. The main service-linked role used by Reachability Analyzer is called AWSServiceRoleForReachabilityAnalyzer. This role cannot be edited, but you can delete it if you are finished with multi-account analysis. To delete the role, you must first disable the integration of Reachability Analyzer with AWS Organizations. The documentation provides instructions on how to enable, edit, and delete service-linked roles for Reachability Analyzer.
