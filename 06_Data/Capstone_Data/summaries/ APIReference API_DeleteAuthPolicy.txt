The AWS API reference documentation provides information on how to delete an auth policy using the DeleteAuthPolicy API. This API allows users to delete the specified auth policy for a resource. If the auth policy is set to AWS_IAM and it is deleted, all requests will be denied. To completely remove the auth policy, the auth type must be set to NONE. If auth is enabled on the resource but no auth policy is set, all requests will be denied. The request requires the resource identifier as a URI parameter. The response will be an HTTP 204 response with an empty body if the action is successful. Possible errors include AccessDeniedException, InternalServerException, ResourceNotFoundException, ThrottlingException, and ValidationException. The API can be used with various AWS SDKs and the AWS Command Line Interface.
