This documentation provides instructions on how to create a top-level IPv4 pool in Amazon VPC's IP Address Manager (IPAM). The pool is created by provisioning a CIDR for the pool and assigning that space to an allocation. Allocation rules can be configured to control the import of CIDRs, netmask length, tags, and locale for resources within the pool. The documentation also includes AWS CLI commands for creating and editing the pool.
