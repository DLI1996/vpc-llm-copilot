This documentation is about the AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways API, specifically the ListPeerings operation. It provides information on the request syntax, URI request parameters, request body, response syntax, response elements, and errors. The ListPeerings operation lists the peerings for a core network and allows users to specify parameters such as core network ID, edge location, maximum results, next token, peering type, and state. The response includes the next token for pagination and a list of peering objects. Common errors and related AWS SDKs are also mentioned.
