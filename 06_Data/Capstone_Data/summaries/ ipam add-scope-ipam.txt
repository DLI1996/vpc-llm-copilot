This documentation is about creating additional scopes in Amazon VPC's IP Address Manager (IPAM). Scopes are containers that represent the IP space for a network. By creating additional private scopes, you can manage resources that use the same IP space across multiple disconnected private networks. The documentation provides step-by-step instructions on how to create an additional private scope using the IPAM console or AWS CLI commands. It also mentions that default scopes are created when you create an IPAM, and you can move CIDRs between scopes.
