This section of the AWS documentation explains how to integrate your IP Address Manager (IPAM) with AWS accounts outside of your organization. By doing so, you can manage IP addresses outside of your organization from a single IPAM account and share IPAM pools with third-party services hosted by other AWS accounts in other AWS Organizations. The section provides considerations and limitations, as well as a process overview for integrating IPAM with external AWS accounts.
