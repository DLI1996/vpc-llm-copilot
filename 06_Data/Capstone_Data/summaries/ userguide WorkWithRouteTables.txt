This documentation provides instructions on how to work with route tables in Amazon VPC. It covers topics such as determining the route table for a subnet, creating a custom route table, adding and removing routes, enabling or disabling route propagation, associating a subnet or gateway with a route table, changing the route table for a subnet, disassociating a subnet from a route table, replacing the main route table, and deleting a route table. The documentation includes step-by-step instructions for performing these tasks using the Amazon VPC console or the command line interface.
