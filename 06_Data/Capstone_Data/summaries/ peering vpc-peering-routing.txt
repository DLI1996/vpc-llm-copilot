This documentation from AWS explains how to update route tables for a VPC peering connection in order to enable private IPv4 traffic between instances in peered VPCs. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to add routes to the route tables associated with the subnets for both instances. It also mentions considerations such as avoiding sending response traffic to the incorrect VPC and the quota on the number of entries that can be added per route table. Additionally, it provides instructions on how to add IPv6 routes for communication between resources in different AWS Regions. The documentation also mentions that the owner of the peer VPC must complete the same steps to add a route back to your VPC. Finally, it provides information on how to add or replace a route using the command line or an API.
