The AWS ModifyVpcEndpoint API allows users to modify attributes of a specified VPC endpoint. The attributes that can be modified depend on the type of VPC endpoint. The API supports various request parameters such as adding or removing route tables, security groups, and subnets associated with the endpoint. It also allows users to modify DNS options, IP address type, policy document, and other configurations. The API returns the ID of the request and a boolean value indicating the success of the request. The documentation provides examples and references to language-specific AWS SDKs for further information.
