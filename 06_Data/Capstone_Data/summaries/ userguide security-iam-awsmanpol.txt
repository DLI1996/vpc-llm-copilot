This summary provides information about AWS managed policies for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). AWS managed policies are standalone policies created and managed by AWS to provide permissions for common use cases. However, they may not provide least-privilege permissions for specific use cases, so it is recommended to define customer managed policies. AWS managed policies cannot be changed, and updates to these policies affect all principal identities attached to them. There are three specific AWS managed policies for Amazon VPC: AmazonVPCFullAccess, AmazonVPCReadOnlyAccess, and AmazonVPCCrossAccountNetworkInterfaceOperations. These policies grant different levels of access to Amazon VPC resources. There have been updates to these policies, adding new actions and permissions related to security group rules, carrier gateways, IPv6 pools, local gateways, and local gateway route tables.
