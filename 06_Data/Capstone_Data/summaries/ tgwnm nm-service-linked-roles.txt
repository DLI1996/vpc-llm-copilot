The AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways service uses service-linked roles to call other AWS services on behalf of users. The service-linked role, named AWSServiceRoleForNetworkManager, has permissions to perform various actions related to network management. Users do not need to manually create this role as it is automatically created when the first global network is created. The role can be edited or deleted if necessary. The service-linked role is available in all AWS regions where the service is available.
