AWS has made updates to its managed policy for IP Address Manager (IPAM). When using IPAM with a single AWS account, the AWSIPAMServiceRolePolicy managed policy is automatically created and attached to the AWSServiceRoleForIPAM service-linked role. If IPAM integration is enabled with AWS Organizations, the managed policy is created in each member account and attached to the service-linked role. This policy allows IPAM to monitor CIDRs associated with EC2 networking resources and store metrics in Amazon CloudWatch. The policy includes permissions for various EC2 and Organizations actions. Additionally, there have been recent updates to the managed policy, including the addition of two actions for IPAM to retrieve information about monitored AWS accounts and resource CIDRs.
