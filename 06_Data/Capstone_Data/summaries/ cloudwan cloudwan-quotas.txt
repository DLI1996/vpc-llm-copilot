The AWS Cloud WAN User Guide provides information on various aspects of AWS Cloud WAN, including general quotas, bandwidth quotas, routing quotas, and maximum transmission unit (MTU) quotas. The guide explains the limitations and restrictions for each quota and provides instructions on how to request quota increases if needed. It also provides information on using equal-cost multipath routing (ECMP) to increase VPN bandwidth and the MTU sizes supported by the core network.
