The AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways User Guide provides documentation on AWS Network Manager and the IAM roles required for multi-account access. The CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole allows delegated administrators and management accounts to access CloudWatch monitoring data from other member accounts. The IAMRoleForAWSNetworkManagerCrossAccountResourceAccess role enables either administrative or read-only access to the global networks console. Permission templates are associated with these roles and determine which accounts can assume them. The templates contain a list of accounts, including the management account and delegated administrators. The templates also specify the actions that can be performed by the roles, such as creating and modifying resources in the global network.
