The AWS User Guide provides documentation on Amazon VPC and specifically covers NAT gateway basics, controlling the use of NAT gateways, working with NAT gateways, API and CLI overview, pricing, and various use cases. A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation service that allows instances in a private subnet to connect to services outside the VPC while preventing external services from initiating connections with those instances. The guide explains how to create, edit, tag, and delete NAT gateways, as well as how to assign private IPv4 addresses and associate Elastic IP addresses with them. It also provides information on NAT gateway characteristics, rules, and limitations, as well as pricing details and troubleshooting tips.
