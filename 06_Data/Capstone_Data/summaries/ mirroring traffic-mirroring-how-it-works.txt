Traffic Mirroring is a feature provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to copy inbound and outbound traffic from network interfaces attached to instances. This mirrored traffic can be sent to another instance's network interface, a Network Load Balancer, or a Gateway Load Balancer. The traffic mirror source and target can be in the same VPC or different VPCs connected through various methods. To set up Traffic Mirroring, users need to identify the traffic mirror sources, configure the traffic mirror target and filter, and create the traffic mirror sessions. The documentation provides information on targets, filters, sessions, connectivity options, and packet format for Traffic Mirroring.
