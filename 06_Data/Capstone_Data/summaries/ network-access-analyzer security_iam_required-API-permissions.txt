The AWS Network Access Analyzer relies on data from various AWS services and requires specific API permissions to function properly. These services include AWS Direct Connect, Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, AWS Global Accelerator, AWS Network Firewall, AWS Resource Groups, AWS Resource Groups Tagging API, and AWS Tiros. Users need permissions to call the Network Access Analyzer APIs for creating, analyzing, viewing, and deleting network access scopes. Additionally, users must have permissions for describe API calls for networking-related resources and tagging-related API calls. The Tiros API calls are also necessary for the Network Access Analyzer to function.
