The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides security features such as security groups, network access control lists (ACL), flow logs, and traffic mirroring to increase and monitor the security of your VPC. Security groups allow specific inbound and outbound traffic at the resource level, while network ACLs control traffic at the subnet level. Flow logs capture information about IP traffic and can help diagnose security group and network ACL rules. Traffic mirroring allows you to copy network traffic for security and monitoring purposes.
