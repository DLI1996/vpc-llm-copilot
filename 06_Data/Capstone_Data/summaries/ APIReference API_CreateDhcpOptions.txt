The AWS CreateDhcpOptions API allows users to create a set of DHCP options for their Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). These options include domain name servers, domain names, NTP servers, NetBIOS name servers, and NetBIOS node types. Users can specify these options and associate them with their VPC. The API provides request parameters, response elements, errors, and examples for creating DHCP options. It also provides links to language-specific AWS SDKs for using the API.
