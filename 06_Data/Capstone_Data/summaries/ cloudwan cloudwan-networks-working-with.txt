The AWS Network Manager is a service that allows users to manage global and core networks. Users can view, edit, and delete networks through the Network Manager console. This includes editing network descriptions, adding or deleting tags, and deleting networks. However, it is important to note that once a network is deleted, it cannot be undone. Users must also delete any associated core networks before deleting a global network. The AWS Cloud WAN User Guide provides detailed instructions on how to work with the AWS Network Manager.
