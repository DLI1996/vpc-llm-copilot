This documentation from AWS provides information on prefix lists in Amazon VPC. Prefix lists are sets of CIDR blocks that can be used to configure and maintain security groups and route tables. There are two types of prefix lists: customer-managed and AWS-managed. Customer-managed prefix lists can be defined and shared with other AWS accounts, while AWS-managed prefix lists are predefined for AWS services. The documentation also covers concepts, rules, and best practices for working with prefix lists, as well as identity and access management for prefix lists.
