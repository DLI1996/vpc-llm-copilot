This document provides an example of edge consolidation with isolated VPCs using AWS Network Manager. The policy creates two segments, development and hybrid. VPC attachments are automatically mapped to the development segment, and VPCs attached to the development segment cannot communicate with each other but can communicate with the VPN. The development segment has a default route that directs traffic back on-premises. The document includes JSON code for configuring the network configuration, segments, segment actions, and attachment policies.
