The AWS Network Manager allows users to add Connect peers to their network attachments. This can be done using either the AWS Cloud WAN console or the command line/API. Users can add a GRE Connect peer or a Tunnel-less Connect peer. The process for adding each type of peer is outlined in the documentation. For GRE Connect peers, users need to provide the GRE outer IP addresses and BGP information. For Tunnel-less Connect peers, users need to provide the appliance's IPv4 address and BGP information. The documentation also provides instructions for creating Connect peers using the command line or API.
