This document provides information on how to monitor AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways using Amazon CloudWatch. CloudWatch collects and processes raw data into readable metrics, which can be accessed for up to 15 months. Users can set alarms to monitor specific thresholds and receive notifications or take actions when those thresholds are met. CloudWatch metrics can be viewed for transit gateways, Site-to-Site VPN connections, and on-premises resources. The document also provides links to additional resources for supported metrics and creating alarms.
