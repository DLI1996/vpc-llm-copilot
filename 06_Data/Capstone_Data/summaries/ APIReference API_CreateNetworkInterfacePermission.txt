The AWS CreateNetworkInterfacePermission API allows you to grant permission to an AWS-authorized account to attach a specified network interface to an instance in their account. The API requires parameters such as the AWS account ID, the type of permission to grant, and the ID of the network interface. The response includes information about the permission and the ID of the request. The API supports various programming languages and requires JavaScript to be enabled to access the AWS documentation.
