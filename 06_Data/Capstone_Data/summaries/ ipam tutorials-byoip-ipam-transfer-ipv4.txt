This document provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to transfer an existing IPv4 CIDR to IPAM (IP Address Manager) in AWS. The tutorial includes instructions on creating AWS CLI named profiles and IAM roles, getting the IPAM's public scope ID, creating an IPAM pool, sharing the IPAM pool using AWS RAM, transferring the BYOIP (Bring Your Own IP) CIDR to IPAM, viewing the CIDR in IPAM, and performing cleanup steps. The tutorial assumes that the user has already brought an IP address range to AWS using the BYOIP process and wants to transfer that range to IPAM.
