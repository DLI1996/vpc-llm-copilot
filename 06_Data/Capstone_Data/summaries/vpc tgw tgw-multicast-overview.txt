This document provides information about multicast concepts and considerations when using AWS Transit Gateway. Multicast is a communication protocol used for delivering data to multiple computers simultaneously. Transit Gateway supports routing multicast traffic between subnets of attached VPCs and acts as a multicast router. The document explains key concepts such as multicast domains, multicast groups, IGMP, multicast sources, and multicast group members. It also provides considerations and limitations for using multicast with Transit Gateway, including the need to create a new transit gateway for multicast support and the requirement to disable Source/Dest check for non-Nitro instances. The document also includes specific instructions for setting up multicast with Windows Server 2019 or 2022.
