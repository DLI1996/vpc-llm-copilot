This documentation from AWS provides tutorials on how to bring public IP address space to AWS and manage it with IPAM (IP Address Manager). Using IPAM allows for improved utilization of public IP addresses across an organization and simplifies the process of bringing IP space to AWS. The tutorial includes steps for authorizing Amazon to advertise the IP address range, creating a ROA object in the RIR (Regional Internet Registry), and creating a certificate for Amazon verification. The documentation also includes instructions for viewing IP address history using the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface).
