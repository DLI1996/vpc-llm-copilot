Amazon VPC publishes data about your VPCs to Amazon CloudWatch in the form of metrics. These metrics help you monitor the size of your VPC and plan for its growth. One important metric is Network Address Usage (NAU), which measures the number of NAU units in a VPC. Monitoring NAU is important because if you exhaust the NAU quota for your VPC, you won't be able to launch new EC2 instances or provision new resources. You can enable or disable NAU monitoring for your VPCs in the Amazon VPC console or through the command line. Additionally, you can create CloudWatch alarms to track NAU utilization and receive notifications when thresholds are crossed.
