The AWS API command "DescribeRouteTables" is used to retrieve information about one or more route tables in your VPC. It provides details such as the association ID, route table ID, destination CIDR block, and more. The command supports various filters to narrow down the results. The response includes the next token for pagination and the route table information. The command can be used with different AWS SDKs and requires JavaScript to be enabled in the browser to access the AWS documentation.
