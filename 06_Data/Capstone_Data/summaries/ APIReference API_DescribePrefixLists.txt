The AWS DescribePrefixLists API allows users to retrieve information about available AWS services in a prefix list format. This includes the prefix list name, prefix list ID, and IP address range for each service. The API provides parameters such as DryRun, Filter, MaxResults, and NextToken to customize the request. The response includes the nextToken, prefixListSet, and requestId elements. The API also provides examples and references to language-specific AWS SDKs for further assistance.
