This documentation is for the AWS API action "AssociateTransitGatewayMulticastDomain". It explains how to associate subnets and transit gateway attachments with a transit gateway multicast domain. The request parameters include "DryRun" (a boolean value to check permissions), "SubnetIds.N" (an array of subnet IDs), "TransitGatewayAttachmentId" (the ID of the transit gateway attachment), and "TransitGatewayMulticastDomainId" (the ID of the multicast domain). The response includes information about the associations and a request ID. The documentation also provides examples and links to language-specific AWS SDKs.
