AWS Reachability Analyzer is a tool that analyzes the network configuration between a source and destination resource in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It builds a model of the network configuration and checks for reachability based on the configuration. It does not send packets or analyze the data plane. The tool supports various resource types as sources, destinations, and intermediate components, such as instances, gateways, network interfaces, and more. It can identify the shortest reachable path and provide information about any components blocking the path. Reachability Analyzer has certain considerations and limitations, such as only supporting IPv4 addresses and not analyzing transit gateway Connect attachments. It also provides documentation to help update the configuration of network resources.
