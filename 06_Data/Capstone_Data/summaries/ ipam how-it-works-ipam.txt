This documentation explains the key concepts of IP Address Manager (IPAM) in Amazon VPC. IPAM allows you to manage and monitor IP addresses in AWS Regions. It consists of scopes, pools, and allocations. Scopes represent the IP space for a network, pools organize IP addresses based on routing and security needs, and allocations assign CIDRs to resources. IPAM can handle private IPv4 CIDRs, owned public IPv4/IPv6 CIDRs, and Amazon-owned public IPv6 space. To use IPAM, you need to create an IPAM in a specific AWS Region.
