The AWS shared responsibility model applies to data protection in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure, while users are responsible for maintaining control over their content and security configuration. AWS recommends protecting account credentials, using multi-factor authentication, SSL/TLS communication, API and user activity logging, encryption solutions, and advanced security services. It is advised not to put confidential information in tags or free-form text fields and to avoid including credentials information in URLs.
