The AWS Documentation for Amazon EC2 provides information on the DescribeVpcs API, which is used to retrieve details about one or more Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). The API allows users to specify filters, such as VPC ID or owner ID, to narrow down the search results. The response includes information about the VPCs, such as their CIDR blocks, DHCP options, and IPv6 associations. The API supports pagination, allowing users to retrieve a specific number of results per request. The documentation also provides examples and references to language-specific AWS SDKs for further assistance.
