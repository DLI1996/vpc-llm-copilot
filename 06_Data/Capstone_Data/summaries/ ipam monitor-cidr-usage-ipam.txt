The summary is about monitoring CIDR usage with the IP Address Manager (IPAM) dashboard in Amazon VPC. The dashboard provides an overview of IPAM pools and CIDRs within a scope. It allows users to customize the dashboard by adding, removing, resizing, and moving widgets. The dashboard displays information such as scope details, resource CIDR types, management state, overlapping resource CIDRs, compliant resource CIDRs, overlap status, compliance status, VPC utilization, subnet utilization, VPCs with highest IPs allocated, subnets with highest IPs allocated, pool assignment, and pool allocation. The information in the dashboard is based on metrics stored in Amazon CloudWatch. Users can also provision additional CIDRs if a pool is almost fully allocated.
