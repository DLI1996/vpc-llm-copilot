This documentation provides instructions on how to move a VPC CIDR (IP address range) from one scope to another in Amazon VPC. It specifies that only VPC CIDRs can be moved and not individual subnet CIDRs. The move can only be done between private scopes and the same AWS account must own both scopes. If a VPC CIDR is currently allocated from a pool in a private scope, it needs to be released before the move can be completed. The documentation provides steps for moving a CIDR using the IPAM console and also mentions the AWS CLI commands that can be used for the same purpose.
