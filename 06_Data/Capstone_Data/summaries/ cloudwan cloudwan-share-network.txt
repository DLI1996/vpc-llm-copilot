The AWS Network Manager allows users to share a core network across accounts or organizations. The network owner has the ability to create, update, and view resource shares, while shared users can accept or reject invitations, view shared resources, and create VPC attachments. To share a core network, users can access the Network Manager console and choose the appropriate options. To stop sharing a core network, users can follow similar steps and choose the "Stop sharing" option.
