AWS CloudTrail is a service that records actions taken in an AWS account, including API calls to the transit gateway. By enabling CloudTrail, users can view and analyze the details of these API calls, such as the request, IP address, and user identity. CloudTrail log files are delivered to an Amazon S3 bucket and can be used for auditing and troubleshooting purposes. The log files contain events for all API calls in the AWS account, and specific transit gateway API calls can be identified using eventSource and eventName elements. The log records provide information about the user, the requested action, and the response elements.
