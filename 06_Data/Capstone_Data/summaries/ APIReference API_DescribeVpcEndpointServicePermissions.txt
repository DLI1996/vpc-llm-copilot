The DescribeVpcEndpointServicePermissions API allows you to retrieve information about the principals (service consumers) that are permitted to discover your VPC endpoint service. You can use this API to check the permissions for a specific service ID and filter the results based on various parameters. The response includes information about the allowed principals, a token to retrieve the next page of results, and the ID of the request. This API can be used with various AWS SDKs and requires JavaScript to be enabled in your browser to access the AWS Documentation.
