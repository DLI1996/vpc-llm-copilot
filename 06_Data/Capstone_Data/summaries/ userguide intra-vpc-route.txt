This documentation provides instructions on how to configure and install a firewall appliance on an EC2 instance in a separate subnet within an Amazon VPC. The firewall appliance is used to inspect traffic between multiple subnets within the VPC. The middlebox routing wizard is a tool that automatically creates and configures the necessary route tables for the subnets and associates them with the appropriate resources. The route tables for each subnet are customized to route traffic to the firewall appliance. The main route table is used for the subnet where the firewall appliance is installed. The documentation also includes information on the tags associated with the route tables created by the middlebox routing wizard.
