This documentation provides information on how to create, view, modify, and delete prefix list references in Amazon VPC using AWS Transit Gateway. A prefix list is a set of CIDR block entries that simplify the management of IP addresses used for routing network traffic. By creating a prefix list reference in a transit gateway route table, each entry in the prefix list is represented as a route in the route table. The documentation provides step-by-step instructions for performing these actions using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.
