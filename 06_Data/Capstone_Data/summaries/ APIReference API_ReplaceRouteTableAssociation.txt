The AWS API operation "ReplaceRouteTableAssociation" allows users to change the route table associated with a subnet, internet gateway, or virtual private gateway in a VPC. This operation can also be used to change the main route table in the VPC. The request parameters include the association ID, the new route table ID, and an optional parameter for checking permissions. The response includes the state of the association, the new association ID, and the request ID. The documentation provides examples and references to other AWS SDKs for using this API.
