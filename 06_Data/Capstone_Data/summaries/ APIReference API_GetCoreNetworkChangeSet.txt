This documentation is about the AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways API, specifically the GetCoreNetworkChangeSet operation. It provides information on the request syntax, URI request parameters, request body, response syntax, response elements, errors, and related API operations. The GetCoreNetworkChangeSet operation returns a change set between the live core network policy and a submitted policy. The request requires parameters such as coreNetworkId, maxResults, and policyVersionId. The response includes core network changes and a next token for pagination. Possible errors include access denied, internal server error, resource not found, throttling, and validation failure. The documentation also provides links to language-specific AWS SDKs and information on enabling JavaScript for using the AWS Documentation.
