The AWS User Guide provides documentation on how to configure routing tables in Amazon VPC for inspecting traffic using a firewall appliance. The guide explains how to use the middlebox routing wizard to automatically create and configure route tables for the internet gateway, destination subnet, and middlebox subnet. The wizard also associates tags with the route tables to indicate their origin and creation date. The guide also provides manual configuration instructions for those who do not use the middlebox routing wizard.
