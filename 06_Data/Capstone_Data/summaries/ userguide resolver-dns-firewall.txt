The AWS documentation explains how to use Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall to filter DNS traffic in Amazon VPC. Users can define domain name filtering rules in rule groups and associate them with their VPCs. DNS Firewall can allow or block lists of domain names and customize responses for blocked queries. Users can also use AWS Firewall Manager to centrally manage DNS Firewall resources across multiple accounts and organizations.
