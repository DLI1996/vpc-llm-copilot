AWS Transit Gateway is a service that allows you to attach VPCs and VPN connections and route traffic between them. It works across AWS accounts and supports dynamic and static routing. You can create and modify transit gateways, share them with other accounts, and accept shared attachments. Transit gateways also support multicast traffic and allow you to create isolated networks. You can manage transit gateways through the AWS console or CLI.
