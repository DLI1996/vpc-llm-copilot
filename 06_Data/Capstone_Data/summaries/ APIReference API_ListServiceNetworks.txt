The AWS ListServiceNetworks API allows users to list the service networks owned by their account or shared with their account. The API provides information about the service networks, including their ARN, creation date, ID, last update date, name, and the number of associated services and VPCs. The API supports pagination and returns a pagination token for the next page of results if available. The API may return errors such as AccessDeniedException, InternalServerException, ThrottlingException, or ValidationException. Users can find more information about using this API in the language-specific AWS SDKs.
