The AWS Network Manager allows users to create and manage core network policies for their AWS resources. The core network configuration section defines the regions where the core network should operate. The segments section defines different segments in the network and allows users to provide descriptions, change defaults, and provide filters. The segment-actions section defines how routing works between segments, including sharing attachments and creating static routes. The attachment-policies section maps attachments to segments using tags or constant values. These policies help users manage and control their network resources in AWS.
