AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways allows users to centrally manage, monitor, and visualize network resources from multiple accounts within an organization in a single global network. To enable multi-account access, users must set up an organization using AWS Organizations and designate delegated administrator accounts. Trusted access must be enabled for the Network Manager service, and delegated administrators must be registered for the organization. Disabling trusted access removes access to global networks tasks within the organization. Delegated administrators have the same permissions as the management account and can register transit gateways from member accounts to the global network. Deregistering a delegated administrator removes their permissions and removes registered transit gateways from the global network.
