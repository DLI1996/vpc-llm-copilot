This summary discusses AWS managed policies for transit gateways in Amazon VPC. AWS managed policies are standalone policies created and managed by AWS to provide permissions for common use cases. However, they may not provide least-privilege permissions for specific use cases, so it is recommended to define customer managed policies. AWS managed policies cannot be changed, and updates to these policies affect all principal identities attached to them. The AWSVPCTransitGatewayServiceRolePolicy is an AWS managed policy attached to the AWSServiceRoleForVPCTransitGateway role, allowing Amazon VPC to create and manage resources for transit gateway attachments. The summary also mentions that Amazon VPC started tracking changes to its AWS managed policies since March 2021.
