Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) is a service that allows users to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network. Users can define their own virtual network with IP address ranges, subnets, gateways, and security groups. VPCs can be connected to the internet, corporate or home networks, and other VPCs. Amazon VPC works by providing a secure and scalable infrastructure for running AWS resources. It includes features such as default and nondefault VPCs, route tables, and access to the internet. Users can also connect their VPCs to their own corporate data centers using IPsec AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections. Additionally, VPC peering connections and transit gateways can be used to connect multiple VPCs and networks. AWS provides a private global network that ensures high-performance and low-latency connectivity between AWS Regions.
