AWS allows users to connect Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) using VPC peering connections. This enables private routing of traffic between VPCs, allowing resources in peered VPCs to communicate as if they are in the same network. VPC peering connections utilize the existing infrastructure of a VPC and do not rely on separate hardware. They can be created between a user's own VPCs, with a VPC in another AWS account, or with a VPC in a different AWS Region. Traffic between peered VPCs does not traverse the public internet. For more information, users can refer to the Amazon VPC Peering Guide.
