This documentation is about the AWS API for creating a target group in Amazon VPC Lattice. A target group is a collection of compute resources that run an application or service. The API provides request syntax, URI request parameters, request body, response syntax, response elements, and possible errors. It also includes information about the target group configuration, such as health checks, port, protocol, and name. The API returns the ARN, ID, name, status, and type of the target group.
