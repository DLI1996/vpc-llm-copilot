The AWS Network Manager allows users to manage their network resources in the AWS Cloud WAN. This includes adding VPC attachments to the core network edge, specifying subnets from each Availability Zone for routing traffic, and enabling appliance mode for stateful network appliances. Users can add VPC attachments using the console or the command line/API. Shared subnets are also supported, but the VPC owner must first share their core network with the VPC owner. The documentation provides step-by-step instructions for adding VPC attachments and includes information on transit gateway route table attachments and Site-to-Site VPN attachments.
