This documentation explains how to delete a VPC peering connection in Amazon VPC. It states that either owner of the VPC in the peering connection can delete it at any time, including when it is still in the pending-acceptance state. However, it cannot be deleted when it is in the rejected state, as AWS automatically deletes it. The documentation also mentions that deleting a VPC that is part of an active peering connection will also delete the peering connection. It provides instructions on how to delete a VPC peering connection through the Amazon VPC console or using the command line or API.
