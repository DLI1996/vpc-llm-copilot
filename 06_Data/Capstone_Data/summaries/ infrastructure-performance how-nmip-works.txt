The AWS Network Manager Infrastructure Performance User Guide provides documentation on how latency is calculated and how infrastructure performance works. Latency metrics are generated by aggregating latency measurements from probes located across AWS Regions and Availability Zones. The probes are not related to EC2 instances or AWS services running in your account. The latency metric data is presented in all AWS accounts. The metric data is generated by computing the median of all latency measurements from AWS managed probes for every five-minute interval. The Infrastructure Performance dashboard also provides a network health status, indicating whether the aggregate network latency is normal or degraded. The service is available in multiple AWS Regions.
