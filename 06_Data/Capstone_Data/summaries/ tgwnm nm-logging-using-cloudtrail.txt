AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways works with AWS CloudTrail to log API calls and capture events for Global Networks. CloudTrail provides a record of actions taken in Global Networks, including calls from the console and code calls to the API operations. By enabling CloudTrail, you can view and analyze the details of requests made to Global Networks, such as the requestor, IP address, and timing. CloudTrail is automatically enabled on your AWS account, but you can create a trail to have a continuous record of events and deliver log files to an S3 bucket. All Global Networks actions are logged by CloudTrail and documented in the Network Manager API Reference.
