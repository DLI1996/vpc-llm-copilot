The default security group in Amazon VPC is named "default" and is automatically associated with any VPCs that are created. It is recommended to create specific security groups for resources instead of using the default security group. However, if a security group is not specified for a resource at creation time, it will be associated with the default security group. The default security group can have its rules changed, but it cannot be deleted. The default rules for the default security group allow inbound traffic from all resources assigned to the group and allow all outbound IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. The default security group is illustrated in a diagram showing its association with EC2 instances in a VPC.
