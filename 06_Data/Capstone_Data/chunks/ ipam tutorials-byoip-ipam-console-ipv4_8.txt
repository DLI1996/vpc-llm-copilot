Do one of the following: If you chose BYOIP in the previous step, under CIDRs to provision, choose a CIDR to provision for the pool. Note that when provisioning an IPv4 CIDR to a pool within the top-level pool, the minimum IPv4 CIDR you can provision is /24; more specific CIDRs (such as /25) are not permitted. You must include the CIDR and the BYOIP message and certificate signature in the request so we can verify that you own the public space. For a list of BYOIP prerequisites including how to get this BYOIP message and certificate signature, see Bring your own public IPv4 CIDR to IPAM using both the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI.
