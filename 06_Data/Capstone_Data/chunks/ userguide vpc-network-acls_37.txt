For IPv4, when a host sends a packet that's larger than the MTU of the receiving host or that's larger than the MTU of a device along the path, the receiving host or device drops the packet, and then returns the following ICMP message: Destination Unreachable: Fragmentation Needed and Don't Fragment was Set (Type 3, Code 4). This instructs the transmitting host to split the payload into multiple smaller packets, and then retransmit them.The IPv6 protocol does not support fragmentation in the network. When a host sends a packet that's larger than the MTU of the receiving host or that's larger than the MTU of a device along the path, the receiving host or device drops the packet, and then returns the following ICMP message: ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) (Type 2). This instructs the transmitting host to split the payload into multiple smaller packets, and then retransmit them.
