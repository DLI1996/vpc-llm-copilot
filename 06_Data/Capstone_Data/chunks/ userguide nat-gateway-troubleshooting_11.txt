Check that you've configured your route tables correctly: The NAT gateway must be in a public subnet with a route table that routes internet traffic to an internet gateway. Your instance must be in a private subnet with a route table that routes internet traffic to the NAT gateway. Check that there are no other route table entries that route all or part of the internet traffic to another device instead of the NAT gateway.Ensure that your security group rules for your private instance allow outbound internet traffic. For the ping command to work, the rules must also allow outbound ICMP traffic. The NAT gateway itself allows all outbound traffic and traffic received in response to an outbound request (it is therefore stateful).
