For Subnets, select one subnet per Availability Zone from which you'll access the AWS service. You can't select multiple subnets from the same Availability Zone. We create an endpoint network interface in each subnet that you select. By default, we select IP addresses from the subnet IP address ranges and assign them to the endpoint network interfaces. To choose the IP addresses for an endpoint network interface, select Designate IP addresses and enter an IPv4 address from the subnet address range. If the endpoint service supports IPv6, you can also enter an IPv6 address from the subnet address range.
