When you transfer an Elastic IP address, there is a two-step handshake between the AWS accounts. When the source account starts the transfer, the transfer accounts have seven days to accept the Elastic IP address transfer. During those seven days, the source account can view the pending transfer (for example in the AWS console or by using the describe-address-transfers AWS CLI command). After seven days, the transfer expires and ownership of the Elastic IP address returns to the source account.Accepted transfers are visible to the source account (for example in the AWS console or by using the describe-address-transfers AWS CLI command) for three days after the transfers have been accepted.
