The combination of permissions and acceptance settings help you control which service consumers (AWS principals) can access your endpoint service. For example, you can grant permissions to specific principals that you trust and automatically accept all connection requests, or you can grant permissions to a wider group of principals and manually accept specific connection requests that you trust.You can configure your endpoint service to accept connection requests automatically. Otherwise, you must accept or reject them manually. If you do not accept a connection request, the service consumer can't access your endpoint service.You can receive a notification when a connection request is accepted or rejected.
