Prefix lists per Region 100 Yes Versions per prefix list 1,000 Yes If a prefix list has 1,000 stored versions and you add a new version, the oldest version is removed so that the new version can be added. Maximum number of entries per prefix list 1,000 Yes You can resize a customer-managed prefix list up to 1000. For more information, see Resize a prefix list . When you reference a prefix list in a resource, the maximum number of entries for the prefix lists counts against the quota for the number of entries for the resource. For example, if you create a prefix list with 20 maximum entries and you reference that prefix list in a security group rule, this counts as 20 security group rules.
