You can explicitly associate a subnet with the main route table, even if it's already implicitly associated. You might want to do that if you change which table is the main route table. When you change which table is the main route table, it also changes the default for additional new subnets, or for any subnets that are not explicitly associated with any other route table. For more information, see Replace the main route table.Custom route tables
