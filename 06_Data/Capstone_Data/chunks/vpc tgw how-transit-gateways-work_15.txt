Transit Gateway only shows a preferred route. A backup route will only appear in the Transit Gateway route table if that route is no longer advertised. For example, if you are advertising the same routes over the Direct Connect gateway and over Site-to-Site VPN. AWS Transit Gateway will only show the routes received from the Direct Connect gateway route, which is the preferred route. The Site-to-Site VPN, which is the backup route, will only display when the Direct Connect gateway is no longer advertised.Consider the following VPC route table. The VPC local route has the highest priority, followed by the routes that are the most specific. When a static route and a propagated route have the same destination, the static route has a higher priority.
