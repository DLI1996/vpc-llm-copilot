The following diagram provides an overview of this scenario. To connect from your computer to the instance in the private subnet, you'll first connect to a bastion host in a public subnet. Both the bastion host and the instance must use the same key pair. Because the .pem file for the private key is on your computer, not the bastion host, you'll use SSH key forwarding. Then, you can connect to the instance from the bastion host without specifying the .pem file in the ssh command. After you set up a VPC endpoint for CloudWatch, traffic from the instance that's destined for CloudWatch is resolved to the endpoint network interface and then sent to CloudWatch using the VPC endpoint.For testing purposes, you can use a single Availability Zone. In production, we recommend that you use at least two Availability Zones for low latency and high availability.TasksStep 1: Create a VPC with subnetsStep 2: Launch the instances
