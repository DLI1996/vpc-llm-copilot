for CIDR allocations in this IPAM pool to be compliant and the largest size CIDR block that can be allocated from the pool. The minimum netmask length must be less than the maximum netmask length. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128. Default netmask length: A default netmask length for allocations added to this pool. For example, if the CIDR that's provisioned to this pool is 2001:db8::/52 and you enter 56 here, any new allocations in this pool will default to a netmask length of /56.Maximum netmask length: The maximum netmask length that will be required for CIDR allocations in this pool.
