Since you are going to create a top-level IPAM pool with a Regional pool within it, and we’re going to allocate space to a resource (an Elastic IP address) from the Regional pool, you will set the locale on the Regional pool and not the top-level pool. You’ll add the locale to the Regional pool when you create the Regional pool in a later step. The IPAM integration with BYOIP requires that the locale is set on whichever pool will be used for the BYOIP CIDR.This step must be done by the IPAM account.To create a poolOpen the IPAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam/.In the navigation pane, choose Pools.By default, when you create a pool, the default private scope is selected. Choose the public scope. For more information about scopes, see How IPAM works.Choose Create pool.(Optional) Add a Name tag for the pool and a Description for the pool.
