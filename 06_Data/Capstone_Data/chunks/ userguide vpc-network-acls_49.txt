Delete a network ACLdelete-network-acl (AWS CLI)Remove-EC2NetworkAcl (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)Example: Control access to instances in a subnetIn this example, instances in your subnet can communicate with each other, and are accessible from a trusted remote computer. The remote computer might be a computer in your local network or an instance in a different subnet or VPC. You use it to connect to your instances to perform administrative tasks. Your security group rules and network ACL rules allow access from the IP address of your remote computer (172.31.1.2/32). All other traffic from the internet or other networks is denied. This scenario gives you the flexibility to change the security groups or security group rules for your instances, and have the network ACL as the backup layer of defense.
