The paths that Network Access Analyzer reports contain a bounded number of resources. Network Access Analyzer does not produce arbitrary length network paths through atypical network configurations, such as load balancers that target themselves, or NAT gateways that send packets immediately to another NAT gateway.Network Access Analyzer does not ensure that the same findings are produced if you analyze the same Network Access Scope in the same network. Network Access Analyzer might produce new findings for existing Network Access Scope analyses if new configurations are supported in the future.Network Access Analyzer reports only unidirectional analysis. That is, Network Access Analyzer findings only indicate that a packet can be sent successfully from a source to a destination.Network Access Analyzer does not report connectivity due to traffic mirroring.A running analysis times out after 1 hour and 30 minutes.
