In the following example, suppose that the VPC has both an IPv4 CIDR block and an IPv6 CIDR block. IPv4 and IPv6 traffic are treated separately, as shown in the following route table.10.0.0.0/16 Local 2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56 Local 172.31.0.0/16 pcx-11223344556677889 0.0.0.0/0 igw-12345678901234567 ::/0 eigw-aabbccddee1122334IPv4 traffic to be routed within the VPC (10.0.0.0/16) is covered by the Local route.IPv6 traffic to be routed within the VPC (2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56) is covered by the Local route.
