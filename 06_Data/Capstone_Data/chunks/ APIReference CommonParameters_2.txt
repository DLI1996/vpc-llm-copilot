The date that is used to create the signature. The format must be ISO 8601 basic format (YYYYMMDD'T'HHMMSS'Z'). For example, the following date time is a valid X-Amz-Date value: 20120325T120000Z. Condition: X-Amz-Date is optional for all requests; it can be used to override the date used for signing requests. If the Date header is specified in the ISO 8601 basic format, X-Amz-Date is not required. When X-Amz-Date is used, it always overrides the value of the Date header.
