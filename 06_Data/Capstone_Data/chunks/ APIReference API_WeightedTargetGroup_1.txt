Only required if you specify multiple target groups for a forward action. The weight determines how requests are distributed to the target group. For example, if you specify two target groups, each with a weight of 10, each target group receives half the requests. If you specify two target groups, one with a weight of 10 and the other with a weight of 20, the target group with a weight of 20 receives twice as many requests as the other target group. If there's only one target group specified, then the default value is 100. Type: Integer Valid Range: Minimum value of 0. Maximum value of 999.
