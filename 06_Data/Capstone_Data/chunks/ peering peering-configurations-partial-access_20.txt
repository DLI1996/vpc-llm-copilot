Multiple VPC configurationsIn this configuration, there is a central VPC (VPC A) is peered with multiple VPCs in a spoke configuration. You also have three VPCs (VPCs X, Y, and Z) peered in a full mesh configuration.VPC D also has a VPC peering connection with VPC X (pcx-ddddxxxx). VPC A and VPC X have overlapping CIDR blocks. This means that peering traffic between VPC A and VPC D is limited to a specific subnet (subnet 2) in VPC D. This is to ensure that if VPC D receives a request from VPC A or VPC X, it sends the response traffic to the correct VPC. AWS does not support unicast reverse path forwarding in VPC peering connections that checks the source IP of packets and routes reply packets back to the source. For more information, see Routing for response traffic.
