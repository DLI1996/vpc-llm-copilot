Private DNS names are not supported for Gateway Load Balancer endpoints.To verify a domain, you must have a public hostname or a public DNS provider.You can verify the domain of a subdomain. For example, you can verify example.com, instead of a.example.com. As specified in RFC 1034, each DNS label can have up to 63 characters and the whole domain name must not exceed a total length of 255 characters. If you add an additional subdomain, you must verify the subdomain, or the domain. For example, let's say you had a.example.com, and verified example.com. You now add b.example.com as a private DNS name. You must verify example.com or b.example.com before service consumers can use the name.Domain ownership verification
