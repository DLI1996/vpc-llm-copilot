In the following example, there are four AWS Regions, us-west-1 us-west-2, us-east-1, and us-east-2. Each Region is labeled and represented by a number, indicating the number of transit gateways in that Region. For example, us-east-2 is represented by the number 3, indicating that there are three network resources associated with the us-west-2 Region.If your account is a delegated administrator in a multi-account environment, you can view details about the transit gateways for different accounts.
