Network packet loss can be caused by a number of factors, including network flow collisions, lower level (Layer 2) errors, and other network failures. We engineer and operate our networks to minimize packet loss. We measure packet-loss rate (PLR) across the global backbone that connects the AWS Regions. We operate our backbone network to target a p99 of the hourly PLR of less than 0.0001%.Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
