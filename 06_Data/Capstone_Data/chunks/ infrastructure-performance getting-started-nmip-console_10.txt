Statistic is the median value of the metric. In this example, p50 is the statistic of all the data points gathered within those five minutes. Notep50 is the only supported statistic.Period indicates the interval at which performance the metric is returned. In this example, aggregated-latency metrics are returned for every five-minutes.The results return the following:{ "DataResponses": [{ "Id": "id1", "Source": "us-east-1", "Destination": "us-west-2", "Metric": "aggregate-latency", "Statistic": "p50", "Period": "five-minutes", "MetricPoints": [{ "StartDate": "2022-10-26T12:00:00+00:00", "EndDate": "2022-10-26T12:05:00+00:00", "Value": 62.44349, "Status": "OK" },
