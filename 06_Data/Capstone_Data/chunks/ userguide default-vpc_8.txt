You can create a default subnet in an Availability Zone that does not have one. For example, you might want to create a default subnet if you have deleted a default subnet, or if AWS has added a new Availability Zone and did not automatically create a default subnet for that zone in your default VPC.When you create a default subnet, it is created with a size /20 IPv4 CIDR block in the next available contiguous space in your default VPC. The following rules apply:You cannot specify the CIDR block yourself.You cannot restore a previous default subnet that you deleted.You can have only one default subnet per Availability Zone.You cannot create a default subnet in a nondefault VPC.If there is not enough address space in your default VPC to create a size /20 CIDR block, the request fails. If you need more address space, you can add an IPv4 CIDR block to your VPC.
