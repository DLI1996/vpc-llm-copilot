The following diagram shows how instances can access on-premises resources through AWS VPN. Traffic from the instances is routed to a virtual private gateway, over the VPN connection, to the customer gateway, and then to the destination in the on-premises network. However, suppose that the destination allows traffic only from a specific IP address range, such as 100.64.1.0/28. This would prevent traffic from these instances from reaching the on-premises network.
