The NAT gateway sends the translated IPv4 packets to the destination through the internet gateway, virtual private gateway, or transit gateway and initiates a connection.The IPv4-only host sends back IPv4 response packets. Once a connection is established, NAT gateway accepts the response IPv4 packets from the external hosts.The response IPv4 packets are destined for NAT gateway, which receives the packets and de-NATs them by replacing its IP (destination IP) with the hostâ€™s IPv6 address and prepending back 64:ff9b::/96 to the source IPv4 address. The packet then flows to the host following the local route.In this way, the NAT gateway enables your IPv6-only workloads in an Amazon VPC subnet to communicate with IPv4-only services anywhere outside the subnet.Configure DNS64 and NAT64Follow the steps in this section to configure DNS64 and NAT64 to enable communication with IPv4-only services.Contents
