The following rules apply when you add IPv4 CIDR blocks to a VPC that's part of a VPC peering connection: If the VPC peering connection is active, you can add CIDR blocks to a VPC provided they do not overlap with a CIDR block of the peer VPC. If the VPC peering connection is pending-acceptance, the owner of the requester VPC cannot add any CIDR block to the VPC, regardless of whether it overlaps with the CIDR block of the accepter VPC. Either the owner of the accepter VPC must accept the peering connection, or the owner of the requester VPC must delete the VPC peering connection request, add the CIDR block, and then request a new VPC peering connection.
