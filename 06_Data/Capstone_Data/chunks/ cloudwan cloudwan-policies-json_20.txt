share-with — An array of segments that will have reachability with the segment defined. The core network will create mutual advertisements between these share-with segments and the defined segment attachments. For example, if you create a share between a segment named shared-services and share-with “A” and “B”, this allows the attachments from “A” and “B” to reach “Shared services”. “A” and “B” cannot reach each other, and any static routes or routes propagated from other segments are not shared among these segments. Use “” as a wild card to reference all segments instead of explicitly calling out segments individually.
