If your VPC attachments span multiple Availability Zones and you require traffic between source and destination hosts to be routed through the same appliance for stateful inspection, enable appliance mode support for the VPC attachment in which the appliance is located.For more information, see Centralized inspection architecture in the AWS blog.Behavior when appliance mode is not enabledWhen appliance mode is not enabled, a transit gateway attempts to keep traffic routed between VPC attachments in the originating Availability Zone until it reaches its destination. Traffic crosses Availability Zones between attachments only if there is an Availability Zone failure or if there are no subnets associated with a VPC attachment in that Availability Zone.
