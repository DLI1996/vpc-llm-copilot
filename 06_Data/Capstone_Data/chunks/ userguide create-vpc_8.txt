For Number of Availability Zones (AZs), we recommend that you provision subnets in at least two Availability Zones for a production environment. To choose the AZs for your subnets, expand Customize AZs. Otherwise, let AWS choose them for you.To configure your subnets, choose values for Number of public subnets and Number of private subnets. To choose the IP address ranges for your subnets, expand Customize subnets CIDR blocks. Otherwise, let AWS choose them for you.(Optional) If resources in a private subnet need access to the public internet over IPv4, for NAT gateways, choose the number of AZs in which to create NAT gateways. In production, we recommend that you deploy a NAT gateway in each AZ with resources that need access to the public internet. Note that there is a cost associated with NAT gateways. For more information, see Pricing.
