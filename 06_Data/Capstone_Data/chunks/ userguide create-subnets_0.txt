AWSDocumentationAmazon VPCUser GuideCreate a subnetUse the following procedure to create subnets for your virtual private cloud (VPC). Depending on the connectivity that you need, you might also need to add gateways and route tables.ConsiderationsYou must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the subnet from the range of your VPC. You can optionally specify an IPv6 CIDR block for a subnet if there is an IPv6 CIDR block associated with the VPC. For more information, see IP addressing for your VPCs and subnets.If you create an IPv6-only subnet, be aware of the following. An EC2 instance launched in an IPv6-only subnet receives an IPv6 address but not an IPv4 address. Any instances that you launch into an IPv6-only subnet must be instances built on the Nitro System.
