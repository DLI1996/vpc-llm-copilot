Consider the following scenario where you have three VPCs that are attached to a transit gateway. In this scenario, all attachments are associated with the transit gateway route table and propagate to the transit gateway route table. Therefore, all attachments can route packets to each other, with the transit gateway serving as a simple layer 3 IP hub.For example, you have two VPCs, with the following information:VPC A: 10.1.0.0/16, attachment ID tgw-attach-11111111111111111VPC B: 10.2.0.0/16, attachment ID tgw-attach-22222222222222222To enable traffic between the VPCs and allow access to the transit gateway, the VPC A route table is configured as follows.10.1.0.0/16 local 10.0.0.0/8 tgw-idThe following is an example of the transit gateway route table entries for the VPC attachments.
