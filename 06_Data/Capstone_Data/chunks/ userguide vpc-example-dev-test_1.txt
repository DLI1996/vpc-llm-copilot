The following diagram provides an overview of the resources included in this example. The VPC has a public subnet in a single Availability Zone and an internet gateway. The server is an EC2 instance that runs in the public subnet. The security group for the instance allows SSH traffic from your own computer, plus any other traffic specifically required for your development or testing activities.RoutingWhen you create this VPC by using the Amazon VPC console, we create a route table for the public subnet with local routes and routes to the internet gateway. The following is an example of the route table with routes for both IPv4 and IPv6. If you create an IPv4-only subnet instead of a dual stack subnet, your route table has only the IPv4 routes.
