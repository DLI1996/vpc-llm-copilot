When you create a transit gateway, we create a default transit gateway route table and use it as the default association route table and the default propagation route table. If you choose not to create the default transit gateway route table, you can create one later on. For more information about routes and route tables, see Routing.To create a transit gateway using the consoleOpen the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.On the navigation pane, choose Transit Gateways.Choose Create transit gateway.For Name tag, optionally enter a name for the transit gateway.
