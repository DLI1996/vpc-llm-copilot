To add an IPv6 route for a VPC peering connectionOpen the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.In the navigation pane, choose Route tables.Select the check box next to the route table that's associated with the subnet in which your instance resides. NoteIf you do not have a route table associated with that subnet, select the main route table for the VPC, as the subnet then uses this route table by default.Choose Actions, Edit routes.Choose Add route.For Destination, enter the IPv6 address range for the peer VPC. You can specify the entire IPv6 CIDR block of the peer VPC, a specific range, or an individual IPv6 address. For example, if the CIDR block of the peer VPC is 2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56, you can specify a portion 2001:db8:1234:1a00::/64, or a specific IP address 2001:db8:1234:1a00::123/128.For Target, select the VPC peering connection.Choose Save changes.
