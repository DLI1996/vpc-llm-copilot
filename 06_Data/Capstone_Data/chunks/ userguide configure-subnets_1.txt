IPv4 only – The subnet has an IPv4 CIDR block but does not have an IPv6 CIDR block. Resources in an IPv4-only subnet must communicate over IPv4.Dual stack – The subnet has both an IPv4 CIDR block and an IPv6 CIDR block. The VPC must have both an IPv4 CIDR block and an IPv6 CIDR block. Resources in a dual-stack subnet can communicate over IPv4 and IPv6.IPv6 only – The subnet has an IPv6 CIDR block but does not have an IPv4 CIDR block. The VPC must have an IPv6 CIDR block. Resources in an IPv6-only subnet must communicate over IPv6. NoteResources in IPv6-only subnets are assigned IPv4 link-local addresses from CIDR block 169.254.0.0/16. These addresses are used to communicate with VPC services like Instance Metadata Service (IMDS).For more information, see IP addressing for your VPCs and subnets.Subnet types
