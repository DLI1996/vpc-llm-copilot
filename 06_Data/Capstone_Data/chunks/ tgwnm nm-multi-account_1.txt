We strongly recommended that you use the global networks console for enabling multi-account settings with global networks, because the console automatically creates all required roles and permissions for multi-account access. Choosing an alternative approach requires an advanced level of expertise, and opens the multi-account set up for your global network to be more prone to error.Multi-account is not available in the AWS GovCloud (US-West) and the AWS GovCloud (US-East) Regions.PrerequisitesTo enable multi-account, you first set up an account in AWS Organizations. This first account becomes the management account. Using this account, you can then add other accounts as member accounts to your organization. For more information about how multi-account support works, see Creating and managing an organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.TasksEnable trusted access
