To enable multi-account access in the global networks console, you first enable trusted access for the Network Manager service, and then register a delegated administrator account for your organization.ImportantWe strongly recommended that you use the global networks console for enabling multi-account settings with global networks, because the console automatically creates all required roles and permissions for multi-account access. Choosing an alternative approach requires an advanced level of expertise, and opens the multi-account set up for your global network to be more prone to error.Multi-account is not available in the AWS GovCloud (US-West) and the AWS GovCloud (US-East) Regions.
