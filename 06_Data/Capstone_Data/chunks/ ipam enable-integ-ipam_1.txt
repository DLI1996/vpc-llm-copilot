Monitor IP address usage in your organization: When you delegate an IPAM account, you give IPAM permission to monitor IP usage across all of your accounts. As a result, IPAM automatically imports CIDRs that are used by existing VPCs across other AWS Organizations member accounts into IPAM.If you do not delegate an AWS Organizations member account as an IPAM account, IPAM will monitor resources only in the AWS account that you use to create the IPAM.Important
