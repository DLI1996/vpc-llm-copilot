You can launch a new Ubuntu instance and ensure that any IPv6 address assigned to the instance is automatically configured on the network interface by specifying the following user data during launch: #!/bin/bashecho "iface eth0 inet6 dhcp" >> /etcbetwork/interfaces.d/60-default-with-ipv6.cfgdhclient -6 In this case, you do not have to connect to the instance to configure the IPv6 address.
