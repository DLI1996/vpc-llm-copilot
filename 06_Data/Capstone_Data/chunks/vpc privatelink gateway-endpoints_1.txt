The following diagram shows how instances access Amazon S3 and DynamoDB through their public service endpoints. Traffic to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB from an instance in a public subnet is routed to the internet gateway for the VPC and then to the service. Instances in a private subnet can't send traffic to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB, because by definition private subnets do not have routes to an internet gateway. To enable instances in the private subnet to send traffic to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB, you would add a NAT device to the public subnet and route traffic in the private subnet to the NAT device. While traffic to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB traverses the internet gateway, it does not leave the AWS network.Access through a gateway endpoint
