Routing through a transit gateway operates at layer 3, where the packets are sent to a specific next-hop attachment, based on their destination IP addresses.ContentsArchitecture diagramResource attachmentsEqual Cost Multipath routingAvailability ZonesRoutingArchitecture diagramThe following diagram shows a transit gateway with three VPC attachments.
