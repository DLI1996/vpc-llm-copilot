To connect your on-premises network to your AWS resources, associate a customer gateway that's in your global network with the device. If you've created a device to represent a virtual appliance sitting inside your VPC, and you've established a Transit Gateway Connect peer from your virtual appliance to your AWS Transit Gateway, associate a Transit Gateway Connect peer with the device to connect your virtual appliance network to your AWS resources. In the following diagram, the on-premises network is connected to a transit gateway through a Site-to-Site VPN connection.You can have multiple devices in a site, which you can associate a device with multiple links. For examples, see Scenarios: Manage transit gateway networks with AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways.
