You can use AWS Network Manager to forward events to CloudWatch, and then route those events to target functions or streams. Network Manager generates events for topology changes, routing updates, and status updates, all of which can be used to alert you to changes in your transit gateways. For more information, see Monitoring your global network with CloudWatch Events in the AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways User Guide.Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
