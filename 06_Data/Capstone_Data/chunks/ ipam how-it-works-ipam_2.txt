An allocation is a CIDR assignment from an IPAM pool to another resource or IPAM pool. When you create a VPC and choose an IPAM pool for the VPCâ€™s CIDR, the CIDR is allocated from the CIDR provisioned to the IPAM pool. You can monitor and manage the allocation with IPAM.IPAM can manage and monitor private IPv4 CIDRs, public IPv4/IPv6 CIDRs that you own, and Amazon-owned public IPv6 space.To get started and create an IPAM, see Getting started with IPAM.Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
