For EC2 instances running a Windows OS, the NetBIOS computer name is a friendly name assigned to the instance to identify it on the network. The NetBIOS name server maintains a list of mappings between NetBIOS computer names and network addresses for networks that use NetBIOS as their naming service. NetBIOS node type (optional): Enter 1, 2, 4, or 8. We recommend that you specify 2 (point-to-point or P-node). Broadcast and multicast are not currently supported. For more information about these node types, see section 8.7 of RFC 2132 and section 10 of RFC1001. For EC2 instances running a Windows OS, this is the method that the instances use to resolve NetBIOS names to IP addresses. In the default options set, there is no value for NetBIOS node type.
