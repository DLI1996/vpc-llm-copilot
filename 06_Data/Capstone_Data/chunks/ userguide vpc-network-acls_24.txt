You add allow rules depending on your use case. For example, you can add a rule that allows outbound TCP and UDP access on port 53 for DNS resolution. For every rule that you add, ensure that there is a corresponding inbound or outbound rule that allows response traffic.The following example shows a custom network ACL for a VPC that has an associated IPv6 CIDR block. This network ACL includes rules for all IPv6 HTTP and HTTPS traffic. In this case, new rules were inserted between the existing rules for IPv4 traffic. You can also add the rules as higher number rules after the IPv4 rules. IPv4 and IPv6 traffic are separate, and therefore none of the rules for the IPv4 traffic apply to the IPv6 traffic.
