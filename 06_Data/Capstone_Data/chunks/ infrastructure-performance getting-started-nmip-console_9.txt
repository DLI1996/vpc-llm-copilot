For more information, see GetAwsNetworkPerformanceData.In the following example, network performance is queried between two Regions, us-east-1 and us-west-2 on 2022-10-26 between a start-time of 12:00:00 and an end time of 12:30:00. The request also uses the following parameters:Metric indicates what type of metric is being requested. In this example, aggregate-latency, indicates that the performance metrics are aggregated and returned for latency.
