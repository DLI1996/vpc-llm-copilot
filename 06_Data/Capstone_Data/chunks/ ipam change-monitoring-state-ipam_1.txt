Monitored: The VPC CIDR has been detected by IPAM and is being monitored for overlap with other CIDRs and allocation rule compliance.Ignored: The VPC CIDR has been chosen to be exempt from monitoring. Ignored VPC CIDRs are not evaluated for overlap with other CIDRs or Allocation rule compliance. Once a VPC CIDR is chosen to be ignored, any space allocated to it from an IPAM pool is returned to the pool and the VPC CIDR will not be imported again via auto-import (if the auto-import Allocation rule is set on the pool).
