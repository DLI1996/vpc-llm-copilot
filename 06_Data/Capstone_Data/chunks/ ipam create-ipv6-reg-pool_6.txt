The locale is the AWS Region where you want this IPAM pool to be available for allocations. For example, you can only allocate a CIDR for a VPC from an IPAM pool that shares a locale with the VPCâ€™s Region. Note that when you have chosen a locale for a pool, you cannot modify it. If the home Region of the IPAM is unavailable due to an outage and the pool has a locale different than the home Region of the IPAM, the pool can still be used to allocate IP addresses. Under Service, choose EC2 (EIP/VPC). The service you select determines the AWS service where the CIDR will be advertisable. Currently, the only option is EC2 (EIP/VPC), which means that the CIDRs allocated from this pool will be advertisable for the Amazon EC2 service
