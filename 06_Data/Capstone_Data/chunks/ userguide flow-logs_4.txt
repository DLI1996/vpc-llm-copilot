If you no longer require a flow log, you can delete it. Deleting a flow log disables the flow log service for the resource, so that no new flow log records are created or published. Deleting a flow log does not delete any existing flow log data. After you delete a flow log, you can delete the flow log data directly from the destination when you are finished with it. For more information, see Delete a flow log.Flow log recordsA flow log record represents a network flow in your VPC. By default, each record captures a network internet protocol (IP) traffic flow (characterized by a 5-tuple on a per network interface basis) that occurs within an aggregation interval, also referred to as a capture window.Each record is a string with fields separated by spaces. A record includes values for the different components of the IP flow, for example, the source, destination, and protocol.
