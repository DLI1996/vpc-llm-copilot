If your VPC is enabled to support DNS hostnames, each instance that receives a public IP address or an Elastic IP address is also given a public DNS hostname. We resolve a public DNS hostname to the public IP address of the instance outside the instance network, and to the private IP address of the instance from within the instance network. For more information, see DNS attributes for your VPC.IPv6 addressesYou can optionally associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC and associate IPv6 CIDR blocks with your subnets. The IPv6 CIDR block for your VPC is automatically assigned from Amazon's pool of IPv6 addresses; you cannot choose the range yourself.
