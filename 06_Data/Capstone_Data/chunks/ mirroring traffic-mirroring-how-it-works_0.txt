You can send the mirrored traffic to the network interface of another instance, a Network Load Balancer that has a UDP listener, or a Gateway Load Balancer that has a UDP listener. The traffic mirror source and the traffic mirror target (monitoring appliance) can be in the same VPC. Or they can be in a different VPCs that are connected through intra-Region VPC peering, a transit gateway, or by a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to connect to a Gateway Load Balancer in a different VPC.
