AWSDocumentationAmazon VPCAWS Transit GatewayOverviewResourcesRoutingExample: Isolated VPCsYou can configure your transit gateway as multiple isolated routers. This is similar to using multiple transit gateways, but provides more flexibility in cases where the routes and attachments might change. In this scenario, each isolated router has a single route table. All attachments associated with an isolated router propagate and associate with its route table. Attachments associated with one isolated router can route packets to each other, but cannot route packets to or receive packets from the attachments for another isolated router.ContentsOverviewResourcesRoutingOverview
