If you use rule properties, the values that you specify (for example, ports) must match the existing rule's values exactly. Each rule has a protocol, from and to ports, and source (CIDR range, security group, or prefix list). For the TCP and UDP protocols, you must also specify the destination port or range of ports. For the ICMP protocol, you must also specify the ICMP type and code. If the security group rule has a description, you do not need to specify the description to revoke the rule.
