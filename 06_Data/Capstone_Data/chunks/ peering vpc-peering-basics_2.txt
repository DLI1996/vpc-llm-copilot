With the default VPC peering connection options, if EC2 instances on either side of a VPC peering connection address each other using a public DNS hostname, the hostname resolves to the public IP address of the instance. To change this behavior, enable DNS hostname resolution for your VPC connection. After enabling DNS hostname resolution, if instances on either side of the VPC peering connection address each other using a public DNS hostname, the hostname resolves to the private IP address of the instance.For more information, see Work with VPC peering connections.VPC peering connection lifecycle
