You can extend this configuration to multiple CIDR blocks. Suppose that VPC A and VPC B have both IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks, and that subnet 1 has an associated IPv6 CIDR block. You can enable VPC B to communicate with subnet 1 in VPC A over IPv6 using the VPC peering connection. To do this, add a route to the route table for VPC A with a destination of the IPv6 CIDR block for VPC B, and a route to the route table for VPC B with a destination of the IPv6 CIDR of subnet 1 in VPC A.
