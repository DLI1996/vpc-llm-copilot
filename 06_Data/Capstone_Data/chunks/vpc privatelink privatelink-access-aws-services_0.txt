The default service endpoints are public interfaces, so you must add an internet gateway to your VPC so that traffic can get from the VPC to the AWS service. If this configuration doesn't work with your network security requirements, you can use AWS PrivateLink to connect your VPC to AWS services as if they were in your VPC, without the use of an internet gateway.You can privately access the AWS services that integrate with AWS PrivateLink using VPC endpoints. You can build and manage all layers of your application stack without using an internet gateway.ContentsOverviewDNS hostnamesDNS resolutionPrivate DNSSubnets and Availability ZonesIP address typesServices that integrate
