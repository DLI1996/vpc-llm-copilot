You can't create a transit gateway attachment for a subnet in a Local Zone. The following diagram shows how to configure your network so that subnets in the Local Zone connect to a transit gateway through the parent Availability Zone. Create subnets in the Local Zones and subnets in the parent Availability Zones. Connect the subnets in the parent Availability Zones to the transit gateway, and then create a route in the route table for each VPC that routes traffic destined for the other VPC CIDR to the network interface for the transit gateway attachment.NoteTraffic destined for a subnet in a Local Zone that originates from a transit gateway will first traverse the parent Region.Create the following resources for this scenario:A subnet in each parent Availability Zone.
