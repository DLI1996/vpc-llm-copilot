When you create a flow log, you can use the default format for the flow log record, or you can specify a custom format.ContentsAggregation intervalDefault formatCustom formatAvailable fieldsAggregation intervalThe aggregation interval is the period of time during which a particular flow is captured and aggregated into a flow log record. By default, the maximum aggregation interval is 10 minutes. When you create a flow log, you can optionally specify a maximum aggregation interval of 1 minute. Flow logs with a maximum aggregation interval of 1 minute produce a higher volume of flow log records than flow logs with a maximum aggregation interval of 10 minutes.When a network interface is attached to a Nitro-based instance, the aggregation interval is always 1 minute or less, regardless of the specified maximum aggregation interval.
