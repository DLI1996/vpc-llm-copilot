If you associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC and assign IPv6 addresses to your instances, instances can connect to the internet over IPv6 through an internet gateway.

IPv6 traffic is separate from IPv4 traffic; your route tables must include separate routes for IPv6 traffic.Learn moreConnect to the internet using an internet gatewayEnable outbound IPv6 traffic using an egress-only internet gatewayConnect to the internet or other networks using NAT devicesAccess a corporate or home networkYou can optionally connect your VPC to your own corporate data center using an IPsec AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection, making the AWS Cloud an extension of your data center.
