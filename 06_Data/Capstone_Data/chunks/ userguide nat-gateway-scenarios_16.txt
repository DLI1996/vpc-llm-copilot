The following diagram shows the key components of the configuration for this scenario. The VPC has its original IP address range plus the allowed IP address range. The VPC has a subnet from the allowed IP address range with a private NAT gateway. Traffic from the instances that is destined for the on-premises network is sent to the NAT gateway before being routed to the VPN connection. The on-premises network receives the traffic from the instances with the source IP address of the NAT gateway, which is from the allowed IP address range.ResourcesCreate or update resources as follows:Associate the allowed IP address range with the VPC.Create a subnet in the VPC from the allowed IP address range.Create a private NAT gateway in the new subnet.
