Maximum transmission unit (MTU)Your AWS account has the following MTU quotas for AWS Cloud WAN:The MTU of a network connection is the size, in bytes, of the largest permissible packet that can be passed over the connection. The larger the MTU of a connection, the more data that can be passed in a single packet. A Cloud WAN core network supports an MTU of 8500 bytes for traffic between VPCs, including Tunnel-less Connect VPC attachments. Traffic over VPN connections can have an MTU of 1500 bytes.Packets with a size larger than 8500 bytes that arrive at the core network are dropped.The core network does not generate the FRAG_NEEDED for ICMPv4 packet, or the Packet Too Big (PTB) for ICMPv6 packet. Therefore, the Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) is not supported.
