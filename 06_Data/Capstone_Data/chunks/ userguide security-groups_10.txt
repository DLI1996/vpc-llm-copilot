You specify where and how to apply the policy in your organization.Audit existing security groups in your organization: You can use an audit security group policy to check the existing rules that are in use in your organization's security groups. You can scope the policy to audit all accounts, specific accounts, or resources tagged within your organization. Firewall Manager automatically detects new accounts and resources and audits them. You can create audit rules to set guardrails on which security group rules to allow or disallow within your organization, and to check for unused or redundant security groups.
