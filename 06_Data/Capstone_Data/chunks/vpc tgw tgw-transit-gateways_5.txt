This should be the ASN for the AWS side of a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) session. The range is 64512 to 65534 for 16-bit ASNs. The range is 4200000000 to 4294967294 for 32-bit ASNs. If you have a multi-Region deployment, we recommend that you use a unique ASN for each of your transit gateways.For DNS support, select this option if you need the VPC to resolve public IPv4 DNS host names to private IPv4 addresses when queried from instances in another VPC attached to the transit gateway.
