The following types of BGP are supported: Exterior BGP (eBGP): Used for connecting to routers that are in a different autonomous system than the transit gateway. If you use eBGP, you must configure ebgp-multihop with a time-to-live (TTL) value of 2. Interior BGP (iBGP): Used for connecting to routers that are in the same autonomous system as the transit gateway. The transit gateway will not install routes from an iBGP peer (third-party appliance), unless the routes are originated from an eBGP peer and should have next-hop-self configured. The routes advertised by third-party appliance over the iBGP peering must have an ASN.
