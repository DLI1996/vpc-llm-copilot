VPC security groups per Region 2,500 Yes This quota applies to individual AWS account VPCs and shared VPCs. If you increase this quota to more than 5,000 security groups in a Region, we recommend that you paginate calls to describe your security groups for better performance. Inbound or outbound rules per security group 60 Yes This quota is enforced separately for IPv4 rules and IPv6 rules. Therefore, for an account with the default quota of 60 rules, a security group can have 60 inbound rules for IPv4 traffic and 60 inbound rules for IPv6 traffic. For more information, see Security group size . A quota change applies to both inbound and outbound rules. This quota multiplied by the quota for security groups per network interface cannot exceed 1,000.
