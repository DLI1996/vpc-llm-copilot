If you associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, we automatically add rules to the default network ACL to allow IPv6 traffic, provided you haven't modified its default rules. If you've modified your default network ACL or if you've created a custom network ACL with rules to control the flow of traffic to and from your subnet, you must manually add rules for IPv6 traffic. For more information, see Control traffic to subnets using network ACLs.Step 4: Change your instance typeAll current generation instance types support IPv6. For more information, see Instance types.
