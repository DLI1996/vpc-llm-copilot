in which you are creating your IPAM is selected as one of the operating Regions by default. For example, if youâ€™re creating this IPAM in AWS Region us-east-1 but you want to create Regional IPAM pools later that provide CIDRs to VPCs in us-west-2, select us-west-2 here. If you forget an operating Region, you can return at a later time and edit your IPAM settings. Choose Create IPAM.
