Each IPv4 address can support up to 55,000 simultaneous connections to each unique destination. A unique destination is identified by a unique combination of destination IP address, the destination port, and protocol (TCP/UDP/ICMP). You can increase this limit by associating up to 8 IPv4 addresses to your NAT Gateways (1 primary IPv4 address and 7 secondary IPv4 addresses). You are limited to associating 2 Elastic IP addresses to your public NAT gateway by default. You can increase this limit by requesting a quota adjustment. For more information, see Elastic IP addresses.You can pick the private IPv4 address to assign to the NAT gateway or have it automatically assigned from the IPv4 address range of the subnet. The assigned private IPv4 address persists until you delete the private NAT gateway. You cannot detach the private IPv4 address and you cannot attach additional private IPv4 addresses.
