If you're using flow logs to diagnose overly restrictive or permissive security group rules or network ACL rules, be aware of the statefulness of these resources. Security groups are stateful â€” this means that responses to allowed traffic are also allowed, even if the rules in your security group do not permit it. Conversely, network ACLs are stateless, therefore responses to allowed traffic are subject to network ACL rules.
