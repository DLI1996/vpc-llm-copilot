Some AWS services allow you to pass an existing role to that service instead of creating a new service role or service-linked role. To do this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the service.The following example error occurs when an IAM user named marymajor tries to use the console to perform an action in Amazon VPC. However, the action requires the service to have permissions that are granted by a service role. Mary does not have permissions to pass the role to the service.In this case, Mary's policies must be updated to allow her to perform the iam:PassRole action.If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.I want to allow people outside of my AWS account to access my Amazon VPC resources
