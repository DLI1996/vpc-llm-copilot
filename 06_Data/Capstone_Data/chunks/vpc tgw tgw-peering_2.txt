Inter-Region gateway peering uses the same network infrastructure as VPC peering. Therefore traffic is encrypted using AES-256 encryption at the virtual network layer as it travels between Regions. Traffic is also encrypted using AES-256 encryption at the physical layer when it traverses network links that are outside of the physical control of AWS. As a result, traffic is double encrypted on network links outside the physical control of AWS. Within the same Region, traffic is encrypted at the physical layer only when it traverses network links that are outside of the physical control of AWS.For information about which Regions support transit gateway peering attachments, see AWS Transit Gateways FAQs.Create a peering attachment
