The client that initiates the request chooses the ephemeral port range. The range varies depending on the client's operating system.Many Linux kernels (including the Amazon Linux kernel) use ports 32768-61000.Requests originating from Elastic Load Balancing use ports 1024-65535.Windows operating systems through Windows Server 2003 use ports 1025-5000.Windows Server 2008 and later versions use ports 49152-65535.A NAT gateway uses ports 1024-65535.AWS Lambda functions use ports 1024-65535.For example, if a request comes into a web server in your VPC from a Windows 10 client on the internet, your network ACL must have an outbound rule to enable traffic destined for ports 49152-65535.If an instance in your VPC is the client initiating a request, your network ACL must have an inbound rule to enable traffic destined for the ephemeral ports specific to the type of instance (Amazon Linux, Windows Server 2008, and so on).
