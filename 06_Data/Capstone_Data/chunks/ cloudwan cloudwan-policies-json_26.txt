attachment-policiesIn a core network, all attachments use the attachment-policies section to map an attachment to a segment. Instead of manually associating a segment to each attachment, attachments use tags. The tags are then used to associate the attachment to the specified segment. A core network supports the following types of attachments:Transit Gateway Connect — connectVPC — vpcVPN — site-to-site-vpnTransit Gateway route table — transit-gateway-route-tableRules are assigned numbers for processing, and are processed in order by number, from lowest to highest. When a match is made, the action is taken and no further rules are processed. A single attachment can only be associated to a single segment. If no rules are matched (for example, there might be a misspelled tag value), the attachment won't be associated to a segment.
