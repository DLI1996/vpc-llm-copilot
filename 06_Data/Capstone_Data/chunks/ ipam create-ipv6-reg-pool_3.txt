When you create your pools based on routing and security needs, you might want to allow only certain resources to use a pool. In such cases, you can set an allocation rule stating that any resource that wants a CIDR from this pool must have a tag that matches the allocation rule tag requirements. For example, you could set an allocation rule stating that only VPCs with the tag prod can get CIDRs from an IPAM pool.ImportantThis topic covers how to create an IPv6 regional pool with either an IP address range provided by AWS. If you want to bring your own IPv4 or IPv6 IP address ranges to AWS (BYOIP), there are prerequisites. For more information, see Tutorial: Bring your IP addresses to IPAM.
