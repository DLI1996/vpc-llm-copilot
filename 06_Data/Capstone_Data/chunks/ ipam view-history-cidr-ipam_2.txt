If you transfer an Elastic IP address to an AWS account within the AWS Organization that's associated with your IPAM, the history for the Elastic IP address before it was transferred will still be visible in IPAM, and a new historical record will be started. If you transfer an Elastic IP address to an AWS account outside of the AWS Organization that's associated with your IPAM, the history related to the Elastic IP address will not visible and IPAM won't show the transferred Elastic IP address. For information about transferring Elastic IP addresses, see Transfer an Elastic IP address in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
