AWSDocumentationAmazon VPCAWS Transit GatewayOverviewResourcesRoutingExample: Centralized routerYou can configure your transit gateway as a centralized router that connects all of your VPCs, AWS Direct Connect, and Site-to-Site VPN connections. In this scenario, all attachments are associated with the transit gateway default route table and propagate to the transit gateway default route table. Therefore, all attachments can route packets to each other, with the transit gateway serving as a simple layer 3 IP router.ContentsOverviewResourcesRoutingOverviewThe following diagram shows the key components of the configuration for this scenario. In this scenario, there are three VPC attachments and one Site-to-Site VPN attachment to the transit gateway. Packets from the subnets in VPC A, VPC B, and VPC C that are destined for a subnet in another VPC or for the VPN connection first route through the transit gateway.
