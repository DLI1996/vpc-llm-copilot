connections, and will use the static route of another Region. If multiple attachments are defined for a single Region, a single attachment will be chosen at random (deterministically random). This is the same case for multiple attachments that are defined across multiple remote Regions. Instead of an array of attachments, you can also provide a blackhole, which drops all traffic to the destination-cidr-blocks. Note AWS Cloud WAN does not propagate blackhole routes.
