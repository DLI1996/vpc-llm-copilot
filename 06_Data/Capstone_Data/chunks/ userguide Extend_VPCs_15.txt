The following diagram shows how to configure your network so that instances in two different Wavelength Zones can communicate. You have two Wavelength Zones (Wavelength Zone A and Wavelength Zone B). You need to create the following resources to enable communication:For each Wavelength Zone, a subnet in an Availability Zone that is the parent Availability Zone for the Wavelength Zone. In the example, you create subnet 1 and subnet 2. For information about creating subnets, see Create a subnet. Use describe-availability-zones to find the parent zone.A transit gateway. The transit gateway connects the VPCs. For information about creating a transit gateway, see Create a transit gateway in the Amazon VPC Transit Gateways Guide.
