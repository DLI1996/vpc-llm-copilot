For more information, see View and update DNS attributes in the Amazon VPC User Guide.To enable IPv6 for an interface endpoint, the AWS service must support access over IPv6. For more information, see IP address types.Create a security group that allows the resources in your VPC to communicate with the endpoint network interfaces for the VPC endpoint. To ensure that tools such as the AWS CLI can make requests over HTTPS from resources in the VPC to the AWS service, the security group must allow inbound HTTPS traffic.If your resources are in a subnet with a network ACL, verify that the network ACL allows traffic between the endpoint network interfaces and the resources in the VPC.There are quotas on your AWS PrivateLink resources.
