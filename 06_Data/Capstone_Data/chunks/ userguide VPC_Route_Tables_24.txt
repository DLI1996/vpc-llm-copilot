Route table rules apply to all traffic that leaves a subnet. Traffic that leaves a subnet is defined as traffic destined to that subnet's gateway router's MAC address. Traffic that is destined for the MAC address of another network interface in the subnet makes use of data link (layer 2) routing instead of network (layer 3) so the rules do not apply to this traffic.Route priorityIn general, we direct traffic using the most specific route that matches the traffic. This is known as the longest prefix match. If your route table has overlapping or matching routes, additional rules apply.ContentsLongest prefix matchRoute priority and propagated routesRoute priority and prefix listsLongest prefix match
