It does not send packets or analyze the data plane.To use Reachability Analyzer, you specify the path for the traffic from a source to a destination. For example, you could specify an internet gateway as the source, an EC2 instance as the destination, 22 as the destination port, and TCP as the protocol. This would allow you to verify that you can connect to the EC2 instance through the internet gateway using SSH.
