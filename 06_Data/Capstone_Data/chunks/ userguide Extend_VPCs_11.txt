AWS Wavelength allows developers to build applications that deliver ultra-low latencies to mobile devices and end-users. Wavelength deploys standard AWS compute and storage services to the edge of telecommunication carriers' 5G networks. Developers can extend a virtual private cloud (VPC) to one or more Wavelength Zones, and then use AWS resources like Amazon EC2 instances to run applications that require ultra-low latency and connect to AWS services in the Region.
