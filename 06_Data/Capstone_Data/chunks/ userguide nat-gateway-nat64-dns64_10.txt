Route 53 Resolver converts the query packet from IPv6 into IPv4 and forwards it to the outbound endpoint. Each IP address of the endpoint represents one ENI that forwards the request to the on-premises IPv4 address of your DNS resolver.The on-premises resolver sends the response packet over IPv4 back through the outbound endpoint to Route 53 Resolver.Assuming the query was made from a DNS64-enabled subnet, Route 53 Resolver does two things: Checks the content of the response packet. If thereâ€™s an IPv6 address in the record, it keeps the content as is, but if it contains only an IPv4 record. It synthesizes an IPv6 record as well by prepending 64:ff9b::/96 to the IPv4 address. Repackages the content and sends it to the service in your VPC over IPv6.Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.
