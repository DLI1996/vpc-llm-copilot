When you attach a VPC to a transit gateway, you must enable one or more Availability Zones to be used by the transit gateway to route traffic to resources in the VPC subnets. To enable each Availability Zone, you specify exactly one subnet. The transit gateway places a network interface in that subnet using one IP address from the subnet. After you enable an Availability Zone, traffic can be routed to all subnets in the VPC, not just the specified subnet or Availability Zone. However, only resources that reside in Availability Zones where there is a transit gateway attachment can reach the transit gateway.We recommend that you enable multiple Availability Zones to ensure availability.Using appliance mode support
