Routes to IPv4 and IPv6 addresses or CIDR blocks are independent of each other. We use the most specific route that matches either IPv4 traffic or IPv6 traffic to determine how to route the traffic.10.0.0.0/16 local 172.31.0.0/16 pcx-11223344556677889 0.0.0.0/0 igw-12345678901234567Route priority and propagated routesIf you've attached a virtual private gateway to your VPC and enabled route propagation on your subnet route table, routes representing your Site-to-Site VPN connection automatically appear as propagated routes in your route table.If the destination of a propagated route overlaps a static route, the static route takes priority.
