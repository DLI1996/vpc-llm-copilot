Additionally, AWS supports managed policies for job functions that span multiple services. For example, the ReadOnlyAccess AWS managed policy provides read-only access to all AWS services and resources. When a service launches a new feature, AWS adds read-only permissions for new operations and resources. For a list and descriptions of job function policies, see AWS managed policies for job functions in the IAM User Guide.AWS managed policy: AmazonVPCNetworkAccessAnalyzerFullAccessPolicyProvides permissions to create, analyze, and delete Network Access Scopes, and to describe network path resources, such as firewalls, internet gateways, load balancers, NAT gateways, network interfaces, transit gateway attachments, VPC endpoints, VPC peering connections, and virtual private gateways.To view the permissions for this policy, see AmazonVPCNetworkAccessAnalyzerFullAccessPolicy in the AWS Managed Policy Reference.
