NoteFlow stickiness in appliance mode is guaranteed only for source and destination traffic that originate towards the Inspection VPC.Stateful appliances and appliance modeWhen appliance mode is enabled, a transit gateway selects a single network interface in the appliance VPC, using a flow hash algorithm, to send traffic to for the life of the flow. The transit gateway uses the same network interface for the return traffic. This ensures that bidirectional traffic is routed symmetricallyâ€”it's routed through the same Availability Zone in the VPC attachment for the life of the flow. If you have multiple transit gateways in your architecture, each transit gateway maintains its own session affinity, and each transit gateway can select a different network interface.
