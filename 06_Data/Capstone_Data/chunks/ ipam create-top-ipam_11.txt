It takes some time for existing VPC CIDR allocations to be auto-imported into IPAM. Minimum netmask length: The minimum netmask length required for CIDR allocations in this IPAM pool to be compliant and the largest size CIDR block that can be allocated from the pool. The minimum netmask length must be less than the maximum netmask length. Possible netmask lengths for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128.Default netmask length: A default netmask length for allocations added to this pool. For example, if the CIDR that's provisioned to this pool is 10.0.0.0/8 and you enter 16 here, any new
