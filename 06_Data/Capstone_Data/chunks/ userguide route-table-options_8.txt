A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that allows you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are part of the same network.To enable the routing of traffic between VPCs in a VPC peering connection, you must add a route to one or more of your subnet route tables that points to the VPC peering connection. This allows you to access all or part of the CIDR block of the other VPC in the peering connection. Similarly, the owner of the other VPC must add a route to their subnet route table to route traffic back to your VPC.For example, you have a VPC peering connection (pcx-11223344556677889) between two VPCs, with the following information:VPC A: CIDR block is 10.0.0.0/16VPC B: CIDR block is 172.31.0.0/16
