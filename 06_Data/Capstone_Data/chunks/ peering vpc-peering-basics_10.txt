If the IPv4 CIDR block of a VPC in a VPC peering connection falls outside of the private IPv4 address ranges specified by RFC 1918, private DNS hostnames for that VPC cannot be resolved to private IP addresses. To resolve private DNS hostnames to private IP addresses, you can enable DNS resolution support for the VPC peering connection. For more information, see Enable DNS resolution for a VPC peering connection.You can enable resources on either side of a VPC peering connection to communicate over IPv6. You must associate an IPv6 CIDR block with each VPC, enable the instances in the VPCs for IPv6 communication, and route IPv6 traffic intended for the peer VPC to the VPC peering connection.
