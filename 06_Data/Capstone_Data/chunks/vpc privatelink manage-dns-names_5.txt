For example, suppose that your domain name is example.com and that Value and Name are as shown in the preceding example output. The following table is an example of the TXT record settings._6e86v84tqgqubxbwii1m.example.com TXT vpce:l6p0ERxlTt45jevFwOCpWe suggest that you use Name as the record subdomain because the base domain name might already be in use. However, if your DNS provider does not allow DNS record names to contain underscores, you can omit the "_6e86v84tqgqubxbwii1m" and simply use "example.com" in the TXT record.After we verify "_6e86v84tqgqubxbwii1m.example.com", service consumers can use "example.com" or a subdomain (for example, "service.example.com" or "my.service.example.com").Add a TXT record to your domain's DNS server
