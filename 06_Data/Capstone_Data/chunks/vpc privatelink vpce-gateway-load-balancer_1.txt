The following diagram shows how application servers access security appliances through AWS PrivateLink. The application servers run in a subnet of the service consumer VPC. You create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint in another subnet of the same VPC. All traffic entering the service consumer VPC through the internet gateway is first routed to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint for inspection and then routed to the destination subnet. Similarly, all traffic leaving the application servers is routed to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint for inspection before it is routed back through the internet gateway.Traffic from the internet to the application servers (blue arrows):Traffic enters the service consumer VPC through the internet gateway.Traffic is sent to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, based on route table configuration.Traffic is sent to the Gateway Load Balancer for inspection through the security appliance.
