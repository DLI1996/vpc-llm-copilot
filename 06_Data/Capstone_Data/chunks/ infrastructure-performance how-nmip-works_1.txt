Intra-Availability Zone latency metrics are generated by aggregating latency measurements between all probes within a single Availability Zone. This includes all probes that are across AWS data centers, and within the same data center, for the chosen Availability Zone.The placement of the probes is not related to EC2 instances or AWS services running in your account. For these reasons, the same latency metric data is presented in all AWS accounts.How latency is calculatedMetric data is generated by computing the median (P50) of all latency measurements from AWS managed probes for every five-minute (5M) interval.
