If an endpoint service is associated with multiple Network Load Balancers, each endpoint network interface is associated with one load balancer. When the first connection from an endpoint network interface is initiated, we select one of the Network Load Balancers in the same Availability Zone as the endpoint network interface at random. All subsequent connection requests from this endpoint network interface use the selected load balancer. We recommend that you use the same listener and target group configuration for all load balancers for an endpoint service, so that consumers can use the endpoint service successfully no matter which load balancer is chosen.There are quotas on your AWS PrivateLink resources.
