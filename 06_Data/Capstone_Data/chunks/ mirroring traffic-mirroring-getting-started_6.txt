For Additional settings, do the following: For Session number, enter 1, which is the highest priority. (Optional) For VNI, enter the VXLAN ID to use for the traffic mirror session. For more information about the VXLAN protocol, see RFC 7348. If you do not enter a value, we assign a random unused number. (Optional) For Packet length, enter the number of bytes in each packet to mirror. To mirror the entire packet, do not enter a value. To mirror only a portion of each packet, set this value to the number of bytes to mirror. For example, if you set this value to 100, the first 100 bytes after the VXLAN header that meet the filter criteria are copied to the target. For Filter, choose your traffic mirror filter.
