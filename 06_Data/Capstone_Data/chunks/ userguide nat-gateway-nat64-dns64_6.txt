Add the following three routes to the route table of the subnet containing the IPv6-only workloads: IPv4 route (if any) pointing to the NAT gateway.64:ff9b::/96 route pointing to the NAT gateway. This will allow traffic from your IPv6-only workloads destined for IPv4-only services to be routed through the NAT gateway.IPv6 ::/0 route pointing to the egress-only internet gateway (or the internet gateway). Note that pointing ::/0 to the internet gateway will allow external IPv6 hosts (outside the VPC) to initiate connection over IPv6. aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id rtb-34056078 --destination-cidr-block0.0.0.0/0 –-nat-gateway-id nat-05dba92075d71c408 aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id rtb-34056078 –-destination-ipv6-cidr-block64:ff9b::/96 –-nat-gateway-id nat-05dba92075d71c408
