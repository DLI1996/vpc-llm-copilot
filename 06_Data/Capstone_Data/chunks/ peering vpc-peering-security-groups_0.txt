AWSDocumentationAmazon VPCVPC PeeringIdentify your referenced security groupsWork with stale security group rulesUpdate your security groups to reference peer security groupsYou can update the inbound or outbound rules for your VPC security groups to reference security groups in the peered VPC. Doing so allows traffic to flow to and from instances that are associated with the referenced security group in the peered VPC.RequirementsThe peer VPC can be a VPC in your account, or a VPC in another AWS account. To reference a security group in another AWS account, include the account number in Source or Destination field; for example, 123456789012/sg-1a2b3c4d.You cannot reference the security group of a peer VPC that's in a different Region. Instead, use the CIDR block of the peer VPC.To reference a security group in a peer VPC, the VPC peering connection must be in the active state.
