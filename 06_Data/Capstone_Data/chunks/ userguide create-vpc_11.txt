(Optional) For Name tag, enter a name for your VPC. Doing so creates a tag with a key of Name and the value that you specify.For IPv4 CIDR block, do one of the following: Choose IPv4 CIDR manual input and enter an IPv4 address range for your VPC. Choose IPAM-allocated IPv4 CIDR block, select your Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) IPv4 address pool and a netmask. The size of the CIDR block is limited by the allocation rules on the IPAM pool. IPAM is a VPC feature that makes it easier for you to plan, track, and monitor IP addresses for your AWS workloads. For more information, see What is IPAM? in the Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide. If you are using IPAM to manage your IP addresses, we recommend that you choose this option. Otherwise, the CIDR block that you specify for your VPC might overlap with an IPAM CIDR allocation.
