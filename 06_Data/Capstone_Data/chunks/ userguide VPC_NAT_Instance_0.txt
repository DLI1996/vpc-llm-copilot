You can use a NAT instance to allow resources in a private subnet to communicate with destinations outside the virtual private cloud (VPC), such as the internet or an on-premises network. The resources in the private subnet can initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the internet, but they can't receive inbound traffic initiated on the internet.ImportantNAT AMI is built on the last version of Amazon Linux, 2018.03, which reached the end of standard support on December 31, 2020. For more information, see the following blog post: Amazon Linux AMI end of life. This AMI will receive only critical security updates (there will be no regular updates).
