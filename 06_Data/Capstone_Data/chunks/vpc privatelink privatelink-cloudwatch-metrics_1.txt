You can use metrics to verify that your system is performing as expected. For example, you can create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor a specified metric and initiate an action (such as sending a notification to an email address) if the metric goes outside what you consider an acceptable range.Metrics are published for all interface endpoints, Gateway Load Balancer endpoints, and endpoint services. They are not published for gateway endpoints. By default, AWS PrivateLink sends metrics to CloudWatch in one-minute intervals, at no additional cost.For more information, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.ContentsEndpoint metrics and dimensionsEndpoint service metrics and dimensionsView the CloudWatch metricsUse built-in Contributor Insights rulesEndpoint metrics and dimensionsThe AWS/PrivateLinkEndpoints namespace includes the following metrics for interface endpoints and Gateway Load Balancer endpoints.
