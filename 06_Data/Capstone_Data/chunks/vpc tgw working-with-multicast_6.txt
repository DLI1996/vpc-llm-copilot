The transit gateway keeps track of hosts that successfully joined the group. In the event of a transit gateway outage, the transit gateway continues to send multicast data to the host for seven minutes (420 seconds) after the last successful IGMP JOIN message. The transit gateway continues to send membership queries to the host for up to 12 hours or until it receives a IGMP LEAVE message from the host.The transit gateway sends membership query packets to all the IGMP members so that it can track multicast group membership. The source IP of these IGMP query packets is 0.0.0.0/32, and the destination IP is 224.0.0.1/32 and the protocol is 2. Your security group configuration on the IGMP hosts (instances), and any ACLs configuration on the host subnets must allow these IGMP protocol messages.
