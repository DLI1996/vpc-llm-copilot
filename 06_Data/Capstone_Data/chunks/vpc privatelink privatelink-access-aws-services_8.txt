In a production environment, for high availability and resiliency, we recommend the following:Configure at least two Availability Zones per VPC endpoint and deploy your AWS resources that must access the AWS service in these Availability Zones.Configure private DNS names for the VPC endpoint.Access the AWS service by using its Regional DNS name, also known as the public endpoint.The following diagram shows a VPC endpoint for Amazon CloudWatch with an endpoint network interface in a single Availability Zone. When any resource in any subnet in the VPC accesses Amazon CloudWatch using its public endpoint, we resolve the traffic to the IP address of the endpoint network interface. This includes traffic from subnets in other Availability Zones. However, if Availability Zone 1 is impaired, the resources in Availability Zone 2 lose access to Amazon CloudWatch.
