AWSDocumentationAWS Network ManagerAWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways User GuideIAM role existsTroubleshoot self-managed role deploymentsAWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways uses AWS CloudFormation StackSets to deploy the required IAMRoleForAWSNetworkManagerCrossAccountResourceAccess role and the CloudWatch monitoring CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole role in your AWS Organizations member accounts for cross-account access. For a CloudFormation StackSets-managed deployment, IAM roles must have the required policies attached, as well as the trusted relationship to allow registered delegated administrators and the management account the ability to assume these roles. In a self-managed deployment, you own the responsibility to attach the appropriate policies and to manage the trusted relationship required for the delegated administrator and management accounts to access multiple accounts.
