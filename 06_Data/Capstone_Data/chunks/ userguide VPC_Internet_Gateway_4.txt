To enable communication over the internet for IPv6, your VPC and subnet must have an associated IPv6 CIDR block, and your instance must be assigned an IPv6 address from the range of the subnet. IPv6 addresses are globally unique, and therefore public by default.In the following diagram, the subnet in Availability Zone A is a public subnet. The route table for this subnet has a route that sends all internet-bound IPv4 traffic to the internet gateway. The instances in the public subnet must have public IP addresses or Elastic IP addresses to enable communication with the internet over the internet gateway. For comparison, the subnet in Availability Zone B is a private subnet because its route table does not have a route to the internet gateway. Instances in the private subnet can't communicate with the internet over the internet gateway, even if they have public IP addresses.
