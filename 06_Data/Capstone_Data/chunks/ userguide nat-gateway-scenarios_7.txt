Launch an instance in your public subnet (use this as a bastion host). In the launch wizard, ensure that you select an Amazon Linux AMI, and assign a public IP address to your instance. Ensure that your security group rules allow inbound SSH traffic from the range of IP addresses for your local network, and outbound SSH traffic to the IP address range of your private subnet (you can also use 0.0.0.0/0 for both inbound and outbound SSH traffic for this test).
