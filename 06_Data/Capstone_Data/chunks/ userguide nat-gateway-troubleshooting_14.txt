Use an instance in a public subnet with a public IP address to trigger a response large enough to cause fragmentation from the specific endpoint.Use the tcpdump utility to verify that the endpoint is sending fragmented packets. ImportantYou must use an instance in a public subnet to perform these checks. You cannot use the instance from which the original connection was failing, or an instance in a private subnet behind a NAT gateway or a NAT instance. Diagnostic tools that send or receive large ICMP packets will report packet loss. For example, the command ping -s 10000 example.com does not work behind a NAT gateway.If the endpoint is sending fragmented TCP packets, you can use a NAT instance instead of a NAT gateway.
