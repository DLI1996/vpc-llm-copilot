You can't use the aws:SourceIp condition in an identity policy or a bucket policy for requests to Amazon S3 that traverse a VPC endpoint. Instead, use the aws:VpcSourceIp condition. Alternatively, you can use route tables to control which EC2 instances can access Amazon S3 through the VPC endpoint.The outbound rules for the security group for instances that access Amazon S3 through the gateway endpoint must allow traffic to Amazon S3. You can use the ID of the prefix list for Amazon S3 as the destination in the outbound rule.Gateway endpoints support only IPv4 traffic.
