A transit gateway attachment is both a source and a destination of packets. You can attach the following resources to your transit gateway:One or more VPCs. AWS Transit Gateway deploys an elastic network interface within VPC subnets, which is then used by the transit gateway to route traffic to and from the chosen subnets. You must have at least one subnet for each Availability Zone, which then enables traffic to reach resources in every subnet of that zone. During attachment creation, resources within a particular Availability Zone can reach a transit gateway only if a subnet is enabled within the same zone. If a subnet route table includes a route to the transit gateway, traffic is only forwarded to the transit gateway if the transit gateway has an attachment in the subnet of the same Availability Zone.One or more VPN connections
