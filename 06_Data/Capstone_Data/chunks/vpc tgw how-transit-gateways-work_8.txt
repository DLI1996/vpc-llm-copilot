Your transit gateway routes IPv4 and IPv6 packets between attachments using transit gateway route tables. You can configure these route tables to propagate routes from the route tables for the attached VPCs, VPN connections, and Direct Connect gateways. You can also add static routes to the transit gateway route tables. When a packet comes from one attachment, it is routed to another attachment using the route that matches the destination IP address.For transit gateway peering attachments, only static routes are supported.ContentsRoute tablesRoute table associationRoute propagationRoutes for peering attachmentsRoute evaluation orderRoute tables
