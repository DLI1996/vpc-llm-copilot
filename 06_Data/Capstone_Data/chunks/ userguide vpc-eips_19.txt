If you attempt to transfer an Elastic IP address that has a reverse DNS record associated with it, you can begin the transfer process, but the transfer account will not be able to accept the transfer until the associated DNS record is removed.If you have enabled and configured AWS Outposts, you might have allocated Elastic IP addresses from a customer-owned IP address pool (CoIP). You cannot transfer Elastic IP addresses allocated from a CoIP. However, you can use AWS RAM to share a CoIP with another account. For more information, see Customer-owned IP addresses in the AWS Outposts User Guide.
