For VPN ECMP support, select this option if you need Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) routing support between VPN tunnels. If connections advertise the same CIDRs, the traffic is distributed equally between them. When you select this option, the advertised BGP ASN, the BGP attributes such as the AS-path, and the communities for preference must be the same. NoteTo use ECMP, you must create a VPN connection that uses dynamic routing. VPN connections that use static routing do not support ECMP.For Default route table association, select this option to automatically associate transit gateway attachments with the default route table for the transit gateway.
