AWSDocumentationAmazon VPCIP Address ManagerPlan for IP address provisioningFollow the steps in this section to plan for IP address provisioning by using IPAM pools. If you have configured an IPAM account, these steps should be completed by that account.ImportantTo use IPAM pools across AWS accounts, you must integrate IPAM with AWS Organizations or some features may not work properly. For more information, see Integrate IPAM with accounts in an AWS Organization.In IPAM, a pool is a collection of contiguous IP address ranges (or CIDRs). Pools enable you to organize your IP addresses according to your routing and security needs. You can create pools for AWS Regions outside of your IPAM Region. For example, if you have separate routing and security needs for development and production applications, you can create a pool for each.
