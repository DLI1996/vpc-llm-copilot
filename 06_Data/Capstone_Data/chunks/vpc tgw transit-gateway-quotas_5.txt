There are many factors that can affect realized bandwidth through a Site-to-Site VPN connection, including but not limited to: packet size, traffic mix (TCP/UDP), shaping or throttling policies on intermediate networks, internet weather, and specific application requirements. For VPC attachments, AWS Direct Connect gateways, or peered transit gateway attachments, we will attempt to provide additional bandwidth beyond the default value.
