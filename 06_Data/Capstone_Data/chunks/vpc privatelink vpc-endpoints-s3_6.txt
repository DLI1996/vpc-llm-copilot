When you configure your interface endpoint for Amazon S3 to use private DNS only for the inbound Resolver endpoint, we create an inbound Resolver endpoint. The inbound Resolver endpoint resolves DNS queries to Amazon S3 from on-premises to the private IP addresses of the interface endpoint. We also add ALIAS records for the Route 53 Resolver to the public hosted zone for Amazon S3, so that DNS queries from your VPC resolve to the Amazon S3 public IP addresses, which routes traffic to the gateway endpoint.Private DNSIf you configure private DNS for your interface endpoint for Amazon S3 but do not configure private DNS only for the inbound Resolver endpoint, requests from both your on-premises network and your VPC use the interface endpoint to access Amazon S3. Therefore, you pay to use the interface endpoint for traffic from the VPC, instead of using the gateway endpoint for no additional charge.
