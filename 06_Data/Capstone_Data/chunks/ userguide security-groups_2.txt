Security groups are stateful. For example, if you send a request from an instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to reach the instance regardless of the inbound security group rules. Responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to leave the instance, regardless of the outbound rules.Security groups do not filter traffic destined to and from the following: Amazon Domain Name Services (DNS) Amazon Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Amazon EC2 instance metadata Amazon ECS task metadata endpoints License activation for Windows instances Amazon Time Sync Service Reserved IP addresses used by the default VPC router
