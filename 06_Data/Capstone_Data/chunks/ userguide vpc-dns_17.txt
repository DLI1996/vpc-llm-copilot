To access the resources in your VPC using custom DNS domain names, such as example.com, instead of using private IPv4 addresses or AWS-provided private DNS hostnames, you can create a private hosted zone in Route 53. A private hosted zone is a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic for a domain and its subdomains within one or more VPCs without exposing your resources to the internet. You can then create Route 53 resource record sets, which determine how Route 53 responds to queries for your domain and subdomains. For example, if you want browser requests for example.com to be routed to a web server in your VPC, you'll create an A record in your private hosted zone and specify the IP address of that web server.
