AWS provides features that you can use to increase security for the resources in your VPC. Security groups allow inbound and outbound traffic for associated resources, such as EC2 instances. Network ACLs allow or deny inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. In most cases, security groups can meet your needs. However, you can use network ACLs if you want an additional layer of security. For more information, see Compare security groups and network ACLs.By design, each subnet must be associated with a network ACL. Every subnet that you create is automatically associated with the default network ACL for the VPC. The default network ACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic. You can update the default network ACL, or create custom network ACLs and associate them with your subnets. For more information, see Control traffic to subnets using network ACLs.
