This overview compares these methods.Access through public service endpointsThe following diagram shows how instances access AWS services through the public service endpoints. Traffic to an AWS service from an instance in a public subnet is routed to the internet gateway for the VPC and then to the AWS service. Traffic to an AWS service from an instance in a private subnet is routed to a NAT gateway, then to the internet gateway for the VPC, and then to the AWS service. While this traffic traverses the internet gateway, it does not leave the AWS network.Connect through AWS PrivateLink
