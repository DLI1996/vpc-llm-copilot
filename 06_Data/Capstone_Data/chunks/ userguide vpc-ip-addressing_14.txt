You can bring part or all of your own public IPv4 address range or IPv6 address range to your AWS account. You continue to own the address range, but AWS advertises it on the internet by default. After you bring the address range to AWS, it appears in your account as an address pool. You can create an Elastic IP address from your IPv4 address pool, and you can associate an IPv6 CIDR block from your IPv6 address pool with a VPC.For more information, see Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.Use Amazon VPC IP Address ManagerAmazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) is a VPC feature that makes it easier for you to plan, track, and monitor IP addresses for your AWS workloads.
