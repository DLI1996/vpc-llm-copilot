In the ASN ranges section, do the following: Choose Create. For ASN range, enter the ASN range for the policy version. For example, enter 64512-65334.NoteThe ASN range is left-closed and right-open. This means that the leftmost number is included in the range but the rightmost number is not. For example, if you choose an ASN range of 64900-64903, the actual available ASN range is 64900 through 64902. 64903 is not included. Choose Create ASN range.
