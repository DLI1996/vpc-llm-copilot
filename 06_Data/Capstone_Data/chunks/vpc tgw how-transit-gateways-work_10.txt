When you attach a VPC to a transit gateway, you must add a route to your subnet route table in order for traffic to route through the transit gateway. For more information, see Routing for a Transit Gateway in the Amazon VPC User Guide.Route table associationYou can associate a transit gateway attachment with a single route table. Each route table can be associated with zero to many attachments and can forward packets to other attachments.Route propagationEach attachment comes with routes that can be installed in one or more transit gateway route tables. When an attachment is propagated to a transit gateway route table, these routes are installed in the route table. You can't filter on advertised routes.For a VPC attachment, the CIDR blocks of the VPC are propagated to the transit gateway route table.
