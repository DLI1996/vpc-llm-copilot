ImportantWhen you assign an EIP to a public NAT gateway, the network border group of the EIP must match the network border group of the Availability Zone (AZ) that you're launching the public NAT gateway into. If it's not the same, the NAT gateway will fail to launch. You can see the network border group for the subnet's AZ by viewing the details of the subnet. Similarly, you can view the network border group of an EIP by viewing the details of the EIP address. For more information about network border groups and EIPs, see Allocate an Elastic IP address. (Optional) Choose Additional settings and, under Private IP address - optional, enter a private IPv4 address for the NAT gateway. If you don't enter an address, AWS will automatically assign a private IPv4 address to your NAT gateway at random from the subnet that your NAT gateway is in. Skip to step 11.
