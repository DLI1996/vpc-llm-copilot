scope. For Address family, select IPv6. The toggle Allow CIDRs in this pool to be publicly advertisable appears. By default, all CIDRs in this pool will be publicly advertisable. You cannot enable or disable this option. Choose the Locale for the pool. When you provision an Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block to a pool, it must be provisioned to a pool with a locale (AWS Region) selected. Choosing a locale ensures there are no cross-region dependencies between your pool and the resources allocating from it. The available options come from the operating Regions that you chose for the IPAM when you created it. You can add additional operating Regions at any time.
