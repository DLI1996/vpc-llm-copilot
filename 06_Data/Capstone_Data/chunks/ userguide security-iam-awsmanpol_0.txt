AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles.Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because they're available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining customer managed policies that are specific to your use cases.
