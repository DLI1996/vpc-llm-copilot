A public IP address is assigned from Amazon's pool of public IP addresses; it's not associated with your account. When a public IP address is disassociated from your instance, it's released back into the pool, and is no longer available for you to use. You cannot manually associate or disassociate a public IP address. Instead, in certain cases, we release the public IP address from your instance, or assign it a new one. For more information, see Public IP addresses in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.If you require a persistent public IP address allocated to your account that can be assigned to and removed from instances as you require, use an Elastic IP address instead. For more information, see Associate Elastic IP addresses with resources in your VPC.
