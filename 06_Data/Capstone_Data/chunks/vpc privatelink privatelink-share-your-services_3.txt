A service provider can also associate a private DNS name for their endpoint service, so that service consumers can continue to access the service using its existing DNS name. If a service provider associates a private DNS name with their endpoint service, then service consumers can enable private DNS names for their interface endpoints. If a service provider doesn't enable private DNS, then service consumers might need to update their applications to use the public DNS name of the VPC endpoint service. For more information, see Manage DNS names.IP address typesService providers can make their service endpoints available to service consumers over IPv4, IPv6, or both IPv4 and IPv6, even if their backend servers support only IPv4. If you enable dualstack support, existing consumers can continue to use IPv4 to access your service and new consumers can choose to use IPv6 to access your service.
