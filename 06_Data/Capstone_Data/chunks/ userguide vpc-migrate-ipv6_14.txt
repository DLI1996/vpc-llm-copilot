If you're using a NAT device in your private subnet, it does not support IPv6 traffic. Instead, create an egress-only internet gateway for your private subnet to enable outbound communication to the internet over IPv6 and prevent inbound communication. An egress-only internet gateway supports IPv6 traffic only. For more information, see Enable outbound IPv6 traffic using an egress-only internet gateway.In the navigation pane, choose Route Tables and select the route table that's associated with the private subnet.On the Routes tab, choose Edit routes.Choose Add route. For Destination, specify ::/0. For Target, select the ID of the egress-only internet gateway, and then choose Save changes.For more information, see Example routing options.Step 3: Update your security group rules
