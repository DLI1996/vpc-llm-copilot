To monitor CIDR usage using the IPAM dashboardOpen the IPAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam/. In the navigation pane, choose Dashboard. By default, when you view the dashboard, the default private scope is selected. If you donâ€™t want to use the default private scope, from the dropdown menu at the top of the content pane, choose the scope you want to use. For more information about scopes, see How IPAM works. The dashboard presents an overview of your IPAM pools and CIDRs within a scope. You can add, remove, resize, and move widgets to customize the dashboard.
