If you create a subnet using a command line tool or the Amazon EC2 API, the CIDR block is automatically modified to its canonical form. For example, if you specify 100.68.0.18/18 for the CIDR block, we create a CIDR block of 100.68.0.0/18.Subnet sizing for IPv6If you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, you can associate an IPv6 CIDR block with an existing subnet in your VPC, or when you create a new subnet. A subnet's IPv6 CIDR block is a fixed prefix length of /64.There are tools available on the internet to help you calculate and create IPv6 subnet CIDR blocks. You can find tools that suit your needs by searching for terms such as 'IPv6 subnet calculator' or 'IPv6 CIDR calculator'. Your network engineering group can also help you determine the IPv6 CIDR blocks to specify for your subnets.
