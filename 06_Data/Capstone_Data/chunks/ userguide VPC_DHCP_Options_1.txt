Applications running on EC2 instances can communicate with Amazon DHCP servers as needed to retrieve their IP address lease or other network configuration information (such as the IP address of an Amazon DNS server or the IP address of the router in your VPC).You can specify the network configurations that are provided by Amazon DHCP servers by using DHCP option sets.If you have a VPC configuration that requires your applications to make direct requests to the Amazon IPv6 DHCP server, note the following:An EC2 instance in a dual-stack subnet can only retrieve its IPv6 address from the IPv6 DHCP server. It cannot retrieve any additional network configurations from the IPv6 DHCP server, such as DNS server names or domain names.
