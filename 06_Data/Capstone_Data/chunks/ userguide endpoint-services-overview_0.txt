AWSDocumentationAmazon VPCUser GuideConnect your VPC to services using AWS PrivateLinkAWS PrivateLink establishes private connectivity between virtual private clouds (VPC) and supported AWS services, services hosted by other AWS accounts, and supported AWS Marketplace services. You do not need to use an internet gateway, NAT device, AWS Direct Connect connection, or AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to communicate with the service.To use AWS PrivateLink, create a VPC endpoint in your VPC, specifying the name of the service and a subnet. This creates an elastic network interface in the subnet that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to the service.You can create your own VPC endpoint service, powered by AWS PrivateLink and enable other AWS customers to access your service.
