A gateway VPC endpoint enables you to create a private connection between your VPC and another AWS service. When you create a gateway endpoint, you specify the subnet route tables in your VPC that are used by the gateway endpoint. A route is automatically added to each of the route tables with a destination that specifies the prefix list ID of the service (pl-xxxxxxxx), and a target with the endpoint ID (vpce-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx). You cannot explicitly delete or modify the endpoint route, but you can change the route tables that are used by the endpoint.For more information about routing for endpoints, and the implications for routes to AWS services, see Routing for gateway endpoints.Routing to an egress-only internet gateway
