A group membership starts with the receipt of IGMPv2 JOIN message by the transit gateway and ends with the receipt of the IGMPv2 LEAVE message. The transit gateway keeps track of hosts that successfully joined the group. As a cloud multicast router, transit gateway issues an IGMPv2 QUERY message to all members every two minutes. Each member sends an IGMPv2 JOIN message in response, which is how the members renew their membership. If a member fails to reply to three consecutive queries, the transit gateway removes this membership from all joined groups. However, it continues sending queries to this member for 12 hours before permanently removing the member from its to-be-queried list. An explicit IGMPv2 LEAVE message immediately and permanently removes the host from any further multicast processing.
