An endpoint service is available in the Region where you created it. You can access the endpoint service from other Regions using VPC peering.An endpoint service supports traffic only over TCP.When service consumers retrieve information about an endpoint service, they can see only the Availability Zones that they have in common with the service provider. When the service provider and service consumer are in different accounts, an Availability Zone name, such as us-east-1a, might be mapped to a different physical Availability Zone in each AWS account. You can use AZ IDs to consistently identify the Availability Zones for your service. For more information, see AZ IDs in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
