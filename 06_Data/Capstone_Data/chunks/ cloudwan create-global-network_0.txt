AWSDocumentationAWS Network ManagerAWS Cloud WAN User GuideCreate a global networkThe first step in setting up AWS Cloud WAN is to create a global network. A global network is a single, private network that acts as the high-level container for your network objects. A Global Network can contain both an AWS Transit Gateway and other Cloud WAN core networks. These will appear in the AWS Network Manager console. After you create a global network, you can then create a core network at the same time. You can also choose to create a core network later on.NoteIf you're only creating and managing a global network without a core network, use AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways. For more information, see the AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways User Guide.You can either create a global network using the AWS console or through the command line or API.
