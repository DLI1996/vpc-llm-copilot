are 0 - 128.Default netmask length: A default netmask length for allocations added to this pool. For example, if the CIDR that's provisioned to this pool is 10.0.0.0/8 and you enter 16 here, any new allocations in this pool will default to a netmask length of /16.Maximum netmask length: The maximum netmask length that will be required for CIDR allocations in this pool. This value dictates the smallest size CIDR block that can be allocated from the pool.Tagging requirements: The tags that are required for resources to allocate space from the pool.
