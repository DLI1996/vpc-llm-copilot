Route propagation â€” A VPC, VPN connection, or Direct Connect gateway can dynamically propagate routes to a transit gateway route table. With a Connect attachment, the routes are propagated to a transit gateway route table by default. With a VPC, you must create static routes to send traffic to the transit gateway. With a VPN connection, routes are propagated from the transit gateway to your on-premises router using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). With a Direct Connect gateway, allowed prefixes are originated to your on-premises router using BGP. With a peering attachment, you must create a static route in the transit gateway route table to point to the peering attachment.How to get started with transit gatewaysUse the following resources to help you create and use a transit gateway.How transit gateways workGetting startedDesign best practicesWork with transit gateways
