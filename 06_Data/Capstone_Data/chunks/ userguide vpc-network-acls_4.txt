NACLs are stateless, which means that information about previously sent or received traffic is not saved. If, for example, you create a NACL rule to allow specific inbound traffic to a subnet, responses to that traffic are not automatically allowed. This is in contrast to how security groups work. Security groups are stateful, which means that information about previously sent or received traffic is saved. If, for example, a security group allows inbound traffic to an EC2 instance, responses are automatically allowed regardless of outbound security group rules.Network ACLs can't block DNS requests to or from the Route 53 Resolver (also known as the VPC+2 IP address or AmazonProvidedDNS). To filter DNS requests through the Route 53 Resolver, you can enable Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.
