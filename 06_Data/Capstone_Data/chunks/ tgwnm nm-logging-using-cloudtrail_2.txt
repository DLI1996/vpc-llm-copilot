CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create the account. When activity occurs in Global Networks, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event along with other AWS service events in Event history. You can view, search, and download recent events in your AWS account. For more information, see Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event History.
