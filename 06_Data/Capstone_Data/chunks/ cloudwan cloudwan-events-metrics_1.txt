Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a near-real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources. CloudWatch Events enables automated event-driven computing, as you can write rules that watch for certain events and then trigger automated actions in other AWS services when these events happen. For more information, see the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide.You must first onboard CloudWatch Logs Insights before you can view Events on the AWS Cloud WAN dashboards.
