Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table. A subnet can be explicitly associated with custom route table, or implicitly or explicitly associated with the main route table. For more information about viewing your subnet and route table associations, see Determine which subnets and or gateways are explicitly associated.Subnets that are in VPCs associated with Outposts can have an additional target type of a local gateway. This is the only routing difference from non-Outposts subnets.Example 1: Implicit and explicit subnet associationThe following diagram shows the routing for a VPC with an internet gateway, a virtual private gateway, a public subnet, and a VPN-only subnet.
