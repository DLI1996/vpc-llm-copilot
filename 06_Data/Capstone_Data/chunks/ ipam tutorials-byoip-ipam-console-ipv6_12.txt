a CIDR regardless of its compliance with the pool's allocation rules, so a resource might be imported and subsequently marked as noncompliant.If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs that overlap, IPAM will import the largest CIDR only.If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs with matching CIDRs, IPAM will randomly import one of them only. Minimum netmask length: The minimum netmask length required for CIDR allocations in this IPAM pool to be compliant and the largest size CIDR block that can be allocated from the pool. The minimum netmask length must be less than the maximum netmask length. Possible netmask lengths for IPv4 addresses are 0 - 32. Possible netmask lengths for IPv6 addresses are 0 - 128.Default netmask length: A default netmask length for
