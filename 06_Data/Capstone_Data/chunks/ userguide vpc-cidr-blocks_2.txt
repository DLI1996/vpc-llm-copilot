Some AWS services use the 172.17.0.0/16 CIDR range. To avoid future conflicts, donâ€™t use this range when creating your VPC. For example, services like AWS Cloud9 or Amazon SageMaker can experience IP address conflicts if the 172.17.0.0/16 IP address range is already in use anywhere in your network. For more information, see Can't connect to EC2 environment because VPC's IP addresses are used by Docker in the AWS Cloud9 User Guide.You can create a VPC with a publicly routable CIDR block that falls outside of the private IPv4 address ranges specified in RFC 1918. However, for the purposes of this documentation, we refer to private IP addresses as the IPv4 addresses that are within the CIDR range of your VPC.When you create a VPC for use with an AWS service, check the service documentation to verify if there are specific requirements for its configuration.
