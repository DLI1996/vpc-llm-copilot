AWSDocumentationAWS Network ManagerAWS Cloud WAN User GuideSegmentsYou can use a network segment to divide your global network into separate isolated networks. On the segments page, you create a segment, and then define the attachment communication mapping. Each segment creates a dedicated routing domain. You can create multiple network segments within your global network. Resources that are connected to the same segment can only communicate within the segment. Optionally, you can also set resources in the same segment to be isolated from each other, with access only to shared services. With segments, AWS maintains a consistent configuration across AWS Regions for you, meaning that you don't need to synchronize configuration across every device in your network.To configure a segmentAccess the Network Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.combetworkmanager/home/.Under Connectivity choose Cloud WAN.
