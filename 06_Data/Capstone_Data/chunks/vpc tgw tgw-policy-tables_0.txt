The table contains policy rules for matching network traffic by policy attributes, and then maps the traffic that matches the rule to a target route table.You can use dynamic routing for transit gateways to automatically exchange routing and reachability information with peered transit gateway types. Unlike with a static route, traffic can be routed along a different path based on network conditions, such as path failures or congestion. Dynamic routing also adds an extra layer of security in that it's easier to re-route traffic in the event of a network breach or incursion.Note
