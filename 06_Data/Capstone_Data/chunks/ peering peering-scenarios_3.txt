Your company has a VPC that you want to share with your customers. Each customer can create a VPC peering connection with your VPC, however, your customers cannot route traffic to other VPCs that are peered to yours, nor are they aware of the other customers' routes.You have a central VPC that is used for Active Directory services. Specific instances in peer VPCs send requests to the Active Directory servers and require full access to the central VPC. The central VPC does not require full access to the peer VPCs; it only needs to route response traffic to the specific instances.For more information about creating and working with VPC peering connections in the Amazon VPC console, see Work with VPC peering connections.Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.
