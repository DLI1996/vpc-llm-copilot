When service consumers retrieve information about an endpoint service, they can see only the Availability Zones that they have in common with the service provider. When the service provider and service consumer are in different accounts, an Availability Zone name, such as us-east-1a, might be mapped to a different physical Availability Zone in each AWS account. You can use AZ IDs to consistently identify the Availability Zones for your service. For more information, see AZ IDs in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.There are quotas on your AWS PrivateLink resources. For more information, see AWS PrivateLink quotas.PrerequisitesCreate a service provider VPC with at least two subnets in the Availability Zone in which the service should be available. One subnet is for the security appliance instances and the other is for the Gateway Load Balancer.
