After you've tested route table B, make it the main route table. Subnet B still has an explicit association with route table B. However, subnet A now has an implicit association with route table B, because route table B is the new main route table. Route table A is no longer associated with either subnet.(Optional) If you disassociate subnet B from route table B, there is still an implicit association between subnet B and route table B. If you no longer need route table A, you can delete it.Gateway route tables
