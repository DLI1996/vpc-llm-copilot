To get started, you specify a source and a destination. For example, you can run a reachability analysis between two network interfaces or between a network interface and a gateway. If there is a reachable path between the source and destination, Reachability Analyzer displays the details. Otherwise, Reachability Analyzer identifies the blocking component.TasksStep 1: Create a pathStep 2: Analyze the pathStep 3: Get the results of the path analysisStep 4: Delete the pathStep 1: Create a path
