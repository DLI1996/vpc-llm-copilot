Traffic from an instance in the non-routable subnet of VPC A that is destined for the instances in the non-routable subnet of VPC B is sent through the private NAT gateway and then routed to the transit gateway. The transit gateway sends the traffic to the Application Load Balancer, which routes the traffic to one of the target instances in the non-routable subnet of VPC B. The traffic from the transit gateway to the Application Load Balancer has the source IP address of the private NAT gateway. Therefore, response traffic from the load balancer uses the address of the private NAT gateway as its destination. The response traffic is sent to the transit gateway and then routed to the private NAT gateway, which translates the destination to the instance in the non-routable subnet of VPC A.ResourcesCreate or update resources as follows:
