As a packet comes to the subnet, we evaluate it against the inbound rules of the ACL that the subnet is associated with (starting at the top of the list of rules, and moving to the bottom). Here's how the evaluation goes if the packet is destined for the HTTPS port (443). The packet doesn't match the first rule evaluated (rule 100). It does match the second rule (110), which allows the packet into the subnet. If the packet had been destined for port 139 (NetBIOS), it doesn't match any of the rules, and the * rule ultimately denies the packet.You might want to add a deny rule in a situation where you legitimately need to open a wide range of ports, but there are certain ports within the range that you want to deny. Just make sure to place the deny rule earlier in the table than the rule that allows the wide range of port traffic.
