To enable this feature, add a route to your Outpost rack subnet route table that is more specific than the local route in that route table and has a target type of local gateway. The destination of the route must match the entire IPv4 block of the subnet in your VPC that is in another Outpost. Repeat this configuration for all the Outpost subnets that need to communicate.ImportantTo use this feature, you must use direct VPC routing. You cannot use your own customer-owned IP addresses.Your on-premise network that the Outposts local gateways are connected to must have the required routing so that subnets can access to each other.If you want to use security groups for resources in the subnets, you must use rules that include IP address ranges as source or destination in the Outpost subnets. You cannot use security group IDs.
