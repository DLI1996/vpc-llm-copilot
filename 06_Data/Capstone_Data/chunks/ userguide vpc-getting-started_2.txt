The resources in your VPC communicate with each other and with resources over the internet using IP addresses. When you create VPCs and subnets, you can select their IP address ranges. When you deploy resources in a subnet, such as EC2 instances, they receive IP addresses from the IP address range of the subnet. For more information, see IP addressing for your VPCs and subnets.As you choose a size for your VPC, consider how many IP addresses you'll need across your AWS accounts and VPCs. Ensure that the IP address ranges for your VPCs don't overlap with the IP address ranges for your own network. If you need connectivity between multiple VPCs, you must ensure that they have no overlapping IP addresses.IP Address Manager (IPAM) makes it easier to plan, track, and monitor the IP addresses for your application. For more information, see the IP Address Manager Guide.Select your Availability Zones
