If you use custom DNS domain names defined in a private hosted zone in Amazon Route 53, or use private DNS with interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink), you must set both the enableDnsHostnames and enableDnsSupport attributes to true.The Amazon Route 53 Resolver can resolve private DNS hostnames to private IPv4 addresses for all address spaces, including where the IPv4 address range of your VPC falls outside of the private IPv4 addresses ranges specified by RFC 1918. However, if you created your VPC before October 2016, the Amazon Route 53 Resolver does not resolve private DNS hostnames if your VPC's IPv4 address range falls outside of these ranges. To enable support for this, contact AWS Support.
