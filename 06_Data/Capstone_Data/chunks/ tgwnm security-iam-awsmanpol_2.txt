Additionally, AWS supports managed policies for job functions that span multiple services. For example, the ReadOnlyAccess AWS managed policy provides read-only access to all AWS services and resources. When a service launches a new feature, AWS adds read-only permissions for new operations and resources. For a list and descriptions of job function policies, see AWS managed policies for job functions in the IAM User Guide.AWS managed policy: AWSNetworkManagerReadOnlyAccessYou can attach the AWSNetworkManagerReadOnlyAccess policy to your IAM identities. This policy grants permissions that allow registered delegated administrators and the management account read-only access to global networks.
