After creating the set, you must associate it with the VPC, causing all existing and new instances that you launch in the VPC to use this set of DHCP options. The following are the individual DHCP options you can specify. For more information about the options, see RFC 2132.domain-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four domain name servers, or AmazonProvidedDNS. The default DHCP option set specifies AmazonProvidedDNS. If specifying more than one domain name server, specify the IP addresses in a single parameter, separated by commas. To have your instance receive a custom DNS hostname as specified in domain-name, you must set domain-name-servers to a custom DNS server.
