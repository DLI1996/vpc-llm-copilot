You can move CIDRs from the default private scope to another private scope. For information, see Move VPC CIDRs between scopes.To create an additional private scope Open the IPAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam/. In the navigation pane, choose Scopes. Choose Create scope. Choose the IPAM that you want to add the scope to. Add a description for the scope. Choose Create scope. You can view the scope in IPAM by choosing Scopes in the navigation pane.
