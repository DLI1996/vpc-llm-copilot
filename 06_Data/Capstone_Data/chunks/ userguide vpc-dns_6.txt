A public (external) IPv4 DNS hostname takes the form ec2-public-ipv4-address.compute-1.amazonaws.com for the us-east-1 Region, and ec2-public-ipv4-address.region.compute.amazonaws.com for other Regions. The Amazon DNS server resolves a public DNS hostname to the public IPv4 address of the instance outside the network of the instance, and to the private IPv4 address of the instance from within the network of the instance. For more information, see Public IPv4 addresses and external DNS hostnames in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.DNS attributes in your VPC
