Each VPC uses the default DHCP option set for its Region unless you either create and associate a custom DHCP option set with the VPC or configure the VPC with no DHCP option set. If your VPC has no DHCP option set, the instances in the VPC can't access the internet because they have no access to a DNS server.You can associate a DHCP option set with multiple VPCs, but each VPC can have only one associated DHCP option set.If you delete a VPC, the DHCP option set that is associated with the VPC is disassociated from the VPC.ContentsDefault DHCP option setCustom DHCP option setDefault DHCP option set
