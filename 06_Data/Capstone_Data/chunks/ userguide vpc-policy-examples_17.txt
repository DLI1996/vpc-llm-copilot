The following policy grants roles permission to launch instances into a specific subnet and to use a specific security group in the request. The policy does this by specifying the ARN for the subnet and the ARN for the security group. If roles attempt to launch an instance into a different subnet or using a different security group, the request will fail (unless another policy or statement grants roles permission to do so).The policy also grants permission to use the network interface resource. When launching into a subnet, the RunInstances request creates a primary network interface by default, so the role needs permission to create this resource when launching the instance.{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [{ "Effect": "Allow", "Action": "ec2:RunInstances", "Resource": [ "arn:aws:ec2:
