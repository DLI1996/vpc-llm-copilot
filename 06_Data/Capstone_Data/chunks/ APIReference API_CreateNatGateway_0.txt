This action creates a network interface in the specified subnet with a private IP address from the IP address range of the subnet. You can create either a public NAT gateway or a private NAT gateway.With a public NAT gateway, internet-bound traffic from a private subnet can be routed to the NAT gateway, so that instances in a private subnet can connect to the internet.With a private NAT gateway, private communication is routed across VPCs and on-premises networks through a transit gateway or virtual private gateway. Common use cases include running large workloads behind a small pool of allowlisted IPv4 addresses, preserving private IPv4 addresses, and communicating between overlapping networks.
