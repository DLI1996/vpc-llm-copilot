For example, you use the ping command from your home computer (IP address is 203.0.113.12) to your instance (the network interface's private IP address is 172.31.16.139). Your security group's inbound rules allow ICMP traffic but the outbound rules do not allow ICMP traffic. Because security groups are stateful, the response ping from your instance is allowed. Your network ACL permits inbound ICMP traffic but does not permit outbound ICMP traffic. Because network ACLs are stateless, the response ping is dropped and does not reach your home computer. In a default flow log, this is displayed as two flow log records:An ACCEPT record for the originating ping that was allowed by both the network ACL and the security group, and therefore was allowed to reach your instance.
