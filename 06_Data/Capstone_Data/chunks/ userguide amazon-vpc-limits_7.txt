References to a prefix list per resource type 5,000 Yes This quota applies per resource type that can reference a prefix list. For example, you can have 5,000 references to a prefix list across all of your security groups plus 5,000 references to a prefix list across all of your subnet route tables. If you share a prefix list with other AWS accounts, the other accounts' references to your prefix list count toward this quota.
