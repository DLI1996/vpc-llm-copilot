You can share your VPCs to leverage the implicit routing within a VPC for applications that require a high degree of interconnectivity and are within the same trust boundaries. This reduces the number of VPCs that you create and manage, while using separate accounts for billing and access control. You can simplify network topologies by interconnecting shared Amazon VPCs using connectivity features, such as AWS PrivateLink, transit gateways, and VPC peering.
