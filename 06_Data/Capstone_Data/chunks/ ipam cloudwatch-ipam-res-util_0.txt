These resources include:VPCs (IPv4 and IPv6)Subnets (IPv4)Public IPv4 poolsIPAM calculates and publishes IP utilization metrics separately by IP address family (IPv4 or IPv6). The IP utilization of a resource is calculated across all of its CIDRs of the same address family.For each resource type and address family combination, IPAM uses three rules to determine which metrics to publish:Up to 50 resources with the highest IP utilization. You can use this information to configure alarms to be alerted if an IP utilization threshold is breached.Up to 50 resources with the lowest IP utilization. You can use this information to decide if you want to keep or delete resources that are underutilized.
