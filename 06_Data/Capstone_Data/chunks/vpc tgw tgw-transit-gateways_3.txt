You can optionally associate one or more IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR blocks with your transit gateway. You specify an IP address from the CIDR block when you establish a Transit Gateway Connect peer for a Transit Gateway Connect attachment. You can associate any public or private IP address range, except for addresses in the 169.254.0.0/16 range, and ranges that overlap with addresses for your VPC attachments and on-premises networks. For more information about IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks, see VPCs and subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.TasksCreate a transit gatewayView your transit gatewaysAdd or edit tags for a transit gatewayModify a transit gatewayShare a transit gatewayAccept a resource shareAccept a shared attachmentDelete a transit gatewayCreate a transit gateway
