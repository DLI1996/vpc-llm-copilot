If you chose Public, do the following; otherwise, skip to step 8: Choose an Elastic IP allocation ID to assign an EIP to the NAT gateway or choose Allocate Elastic IP to automatically allocate an EIP for the public NAT gateway. You are limited to associating 2 Elastic IP addresses to your public NAT gateway by default. You can increase this limit by requesting a quota adjustment. For more information, see Elastic IP addresses.
