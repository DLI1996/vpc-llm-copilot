Amazon provides a DNS server (the Amazon Route 53 Resolver) for your VPC. To use your own DNS server instead, create a new set of DHCP options for your VPC.

We also provide a public DNS hostname if the instance is configured with a public IPv4 address and the VPC DNS attributes are enabled.The format of the private DNS hostname depends on how you configure the EC2 instance when you launch it. For more information on the types of private DNS hostnames, see EC2 instance naming.
