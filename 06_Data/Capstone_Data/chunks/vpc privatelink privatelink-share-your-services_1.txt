The following diagram shows how you share your service that's hosted in AWS with other AWS customers, and how those customers connect to your service. As the service provider, you create a Network Load Balancer in your VPC as the service front end. You then select this load balancer when you create the VPC endpoint service configuration. You grant permission to specific AWS principals so that they can connect to your service. As a service consumer, the customer creates an interface VPC endpoint, which establishes connections between the subnets that they select from their VPC and your endpoint service. The load balancer receives requests from the service consumer and routes them to the targets hosting your service.For low latency and high availability, we recommend that you make your service available in at least two Availability Zones.DNS hostnames
