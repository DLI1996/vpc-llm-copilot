When you create your pools based on routing and security needs, you might want to allow only certain resources to use a pool. In such cases, you can set an allocation rule stating that any resource that wants a CIDR from this pool must have a tag that matches the allocation rule tag requirements. For example, you could set an allocation rule stating that only VPCs with the tag prod can get CIDRs from an IPAM pool. You could also set a rule stating that CIDRs allocated from this pool can be no larger than /24. In this case, a resource could still be created using a CIDR larger than /24 from this pool if the space is available, but because doing so violates an allocation rule on the pool, IPAM flags this resource as noncompliant.Important
