VPC Flow Logs is a feature that collects flow log records, consolidates them into log files, and then publishes the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket at 5-minute intervals. Each log file contains flow log records for the IP traffic recorded in the previous five minutes.The maximum file size for a log file is 75 MB. If the log file reaches the file size limit within the 5-minute period, the flow log stops adding flow log records to it. Then it publishes the flow log to the Amazon S3 bucket, and creates a new log file.In Amazon S3, the Last modified field for the flow log file indicates the date and time when the file was uploaded to the Amazon S3 bucket. This is later than the timestamp in the file name, and differs by the amount of time taken to upload the file to the Amazon S3 bucket.Log file format
