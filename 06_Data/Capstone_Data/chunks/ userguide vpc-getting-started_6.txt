Alternatively, register your instances with an internet-facing load balancer. The load balancer receives traffic from the clients and distributes it across the registered instances in one or more Availability Zones. For more information, see Elastic Load Balancing. To allow instances in a private subnet to access the internet (for example, to download updates) without allowing unsolicited inbound connections from the internet, add a public NAT gateway in each active Availability Zone and update the route table to send internet traffic to the NAT gateway. For more information, see Access the internet from a private subnet.Create your VPC
