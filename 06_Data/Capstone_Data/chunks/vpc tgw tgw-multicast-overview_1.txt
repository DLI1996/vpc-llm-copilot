Multicast group — Identifies a set of hosts that will send and receive the same multicast traffic. A multicast group is identified by a group IP address. Multicast group membership is defined by individual elastic network interfaces attached to EC2 instances.Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) — An internet protocol that allows hosts and routers to dynamically manage multicast group membership. An IGMP multicast domain contains hosts that use the IGMP protocol to join, leave, and send messages. AWS supports the IGMPv2 protocol and both IGMP and static (API-based) group membership multicast domains.
