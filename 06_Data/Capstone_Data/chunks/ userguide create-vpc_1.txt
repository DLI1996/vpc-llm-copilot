Discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region. You can use multiple AZs to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data center. If you partition your applications running in subnets across AZs, you are better isolated and protected from issues such as power outages, lightning strikes, tornadoes, and earthquakes.CIDR blocksYou must specify IP address ranges for your VPC and subnets.
