To release an allocation in a public scope, you must delete the resource CIDR. You cannot ignore public resource CIDRs. For more information, see Cleanup in Bring your own public IPv4 CIDR to IPAM using only the AWS CLI or Cleanup in Bring your own IPv6 CIDR to IPAM using only the AWS CLI. After some time, Amazon VPC IPAM will automatically release the allocation on your behalf.For Amazon VPC IPAM to release allocations on your behalf, all account permissions must be properly configured for either single-account use or multi-account use.When you release a CIDR thatâ€™s managed by your IPAM, Amazon VPC IPAM recycles the CIDR back into an IPAM pool. It takes a few minutes for the CIDR to become available for future allocations. For more information about pools and allocations, see How IPAM works.
