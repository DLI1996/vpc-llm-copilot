The following diagram shows two VPCs in a Region. Each VPC has public and private subnets and an internet gateway. You can optionally add subnets in a Local Zone, as shown in the diagram. A Local Zone is an AWS infrastructure deployment that places compute, storage, and database services closer to your end users. When you use a Local Zone, your end users can run applications that require single-digit millisecond latencies. For more information, see AWS Local Zones.Subnet routingEach subnet must be associated with a route table, which specifies the allowed routes for outbound traffic leaving the subnet. Every subnet that you create is automatically associated with the main route table for the VPC. You can change the association, and you can change the contents of the main route table. For more information, see Configure route tables.Subnet settings
