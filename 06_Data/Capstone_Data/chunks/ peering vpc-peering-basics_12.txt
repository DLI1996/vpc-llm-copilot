VPC peering does not support transitive peering relationships. For example, if there are VPC peering connections between VPC A and VPC B, and between VPC A and VPC C, you can't route traffic from VPC B to VPC C through VPC A. To route traffic between VPC B and VPC C, you must create a VPC peering connection between them. For more information, see Three VPCs peered together.Edge to edge routing through a gateway or private connectionIf VPC A has an internet gateway, resources in VPC B can't use the internet gateway in VPC A to access the internet.If VPC A has an NAT device that provides internet access to subnets in VPC A, resources in VPC B can't use the NAT device in VPC A to access the internet.If VPC A has a VPN connection to a corporate network, resources in VPC B can't use the VPN connection to communicate with the corporate network.
