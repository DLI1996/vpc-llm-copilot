The mirrored traffic packet size is greater than the traffic mirror target MTU value.For example, if an 8996 byte packet is mirrored, and the traffic mirror target MTU value is 9001 bytes, the mirror encapsulation results in the mirrored packet being greater than the MTU value. In this case, the mirror packet is truncated. To prevent mirror packets from being truncated, set the traffic mirror source interface MTU value to 54 bytes less than the traffic mirror target MTU value for IPv4 and 74 bytes less than the traffic mirror target MTU value when you use IPv6. Therefore, the maximum MTU value supported by Traffic Mirroring with no packet truncation is 8947 bytes.For more information about configuring the network MTU value, see Network maximum transmission unit (MTU) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
