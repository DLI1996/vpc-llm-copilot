You can't add routes to IPv4 addresses that are an exact match or a subset of the following range: 169.254.168.0/22. This range is within the link-local address space and is reserved for use by AWS services. For example, Amazon EC2 uses addresses in this range for services that are accessible only from EC2 instances, such as the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) and the Amazon DNS server. You can use a CIDR block that is larger than but overlaps 169.254.168.0/22, but packets destined for addresses in 169.254.168.0/22 will not be forwarded.
