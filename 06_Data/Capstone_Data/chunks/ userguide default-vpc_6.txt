Use the Get-EC2Subnet (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)Use the commands with the vpc-id filter and set the filter value to the ID of the default VPC. In the output, the DefaultForAz field is set to true for default subnets.Create a default VPCIf you delete your default VPC, you can create a new one. You cannot restore a previous default VPC that you deleted, and you cannot mark an existing nondefault VPC as a default VPC.When you create a default VPC, it is created with the standard components of a default VPC, including a default subnet in each Availability Zone. You cannot specify your own components. The subnet CIDR blocks of your new default VPC may not map to the same Availability Zones as your previous default VPC. For example, if the subnet with CIDR block 172.31.0.0/20 was created in us-east-2a in your previous default VPC, it may be created in us-east-2b in your new default VPC.
