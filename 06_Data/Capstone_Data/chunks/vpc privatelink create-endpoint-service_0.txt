You are the service provider, and the AWS principals that create connections to your service are the service consumers.Endpoint services require either a Network Load Balancer or a Gateway Load Balancer. The load balancer receives requests from service consumers and routes them to your service. In this case, you'll create an endpoint service using a Network Load Balancer.
