When you create a subnet CIDR reservation, the IP address range can include addresses that are already in use. Creating a subnet reservation does not unassign any IP addresses that are already in use.You can reserve multiple CIDR ranges per subnet. When you reserve multiple CIDR ranges within the same VPC, the CIDR ranges cannot overlap.When you reserve more than one range in a subnet for Prefix Delegation, and Prefix Delegation is configured for automatic assignment, we choose the IP addresses to assign to network interfaces at random.When you delete a subnet reservation, the unused IP addresses are available for AWS to assign to your network interfaces. Deleting a subnet reservation does not unassign any IP addresses that are in use.For more information about Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation, see IP addressing for your VPCs and subnets.Work with subnet CIDR reservations using the console
