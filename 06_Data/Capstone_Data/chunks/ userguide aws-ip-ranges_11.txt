When service A uses resources from service B, there are IP address ranges that are returned by the service codes for both service A and service B. However, these IP address ranges are used exclusively by service A, and can't be used by service B. For example, Amazon S3 uses resources from Amazon EC2, so there are IP address ranges that are returned by both the S3 and EC2 service codes. However these IP address ranges are used exclusively by Amazon S3. Therefore, the S3 service code returns all IP address ranges that are used exclusively by Amazon S3. To identify the IP address ranges that are used exclusively by Amazon EC2, find the IP address ranges that are returned by the EC2 service code but not the S3 service code.Filtering the JSON fileYou can download a command line tool to help you filter the information to just what you are looking for.Windows
