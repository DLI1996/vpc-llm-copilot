IPAM automatically creates the allocation in the pool for you.Manually allocate a CIDR within an IPAM pool to reserve it for later use with an AWS service that's integrated with IPAM, such as Amazon VPC.This section walks you through both options: how to use the AWS services integrated with IPAM to provision an IPAM pool CIDR, and how to manually reserve IP address space.Contents
