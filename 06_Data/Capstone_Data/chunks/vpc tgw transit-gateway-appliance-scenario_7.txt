The following diagram shows a traffic flow when appliance mode support is not enabled. The response traffic that originates from Availability Zone 2 in VPC B is routed by the transit gateway to the same Availability Zone in VPC C. The traffic is therefore dropped, because the appliance in Availability Zone 2 is not aware of the original request from the source in VPC A.RoutingEach VPC has one or more route tables and the transit gateway has two route tables.VPC route tablesVPC A and VPC BVPCs A and B have route tables with 2 entries. The first entry is the default entry for local IPv4 routing in the VPC. This default entry enables the resources in this VPC to communicate with each other. The second entry routes all other IPv4 subnet traffic to the transit gateway. The following is the route table for VPC A.
