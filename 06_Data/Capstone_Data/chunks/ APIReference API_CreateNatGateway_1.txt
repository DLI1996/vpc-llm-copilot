For more information, see NAT gateways in the Amazon VPC User Guide.ImportantWhen you create a public NAT gateway and assign it an EIP or secondary EIPs, the network border group of the EIPs must match the network border group of the Availability Zone (AZ) that the public NAT gateway is in. If it's not the same, the NAT gateway will fail to launch. You can see the network border group for the subnet's AZ by viewing the details of the subnet. Similarly, you can view the network border group of an EIP by viewing the details of the EIP address. For more information about network border groups and EIPs, see Allocate an Elastic IP address in the Amazon VPC User Guide.Request ParametersThe following parameters are for this specific action.
