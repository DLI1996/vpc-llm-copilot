The following examples show how to calculate NAU.Example 1 - Two VPCs connected using VPC peeringPeered VPCs in the same Region contribute to a combined NAU quota.VPC 1 50 Network Load Balancers in 2 subnets in separate Availability Zones - 600 NAU units 5,000 instances (each with an IPv4 address and IPv6 address) in one subnet and 5,000 instances (each with an IPv4 address and IPv6 address) in another subnet - 20,000 units 100 Lambda functions - 600 NAU unitsVPC 2
