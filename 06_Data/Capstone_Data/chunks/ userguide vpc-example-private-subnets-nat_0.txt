To improve resiliency, you deploy the servers in two Availability Zones, by using an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer. For additional security, you deploy the servers in private subnets. The servers receive requests through the load balancer. The servers can connect to the internet by using a NAT gateway. To improve resiliency, you deploy the NAT gateway in both Availability Zones.ContentsOverviewCreate the VPCDeploy your applicationTest your configurationClean upOverview
