You can review the endpoint routes that we add to your route table, but you cannot modify or delete them. To add an endpoint route to a route table, associate it with the gateway endpoint. We delete the endpoint route when you disassociate the route table from the gateway endpoint or when you delete the gateway endpoint.All instances in the subnets associated with a route table associated with a gateway endpoint automatically use the gateway endpoint to access the service. Instances in subnets that aren't associated with these route tables use the public service endpoint, not the gateway endpoint.
