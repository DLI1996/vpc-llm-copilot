disallows routes from the segments listed in the array. It is applied only after routes have been shared in segment-actions. If a segment is listed in the deny-filter, attachments between the two segments will never have routes shared across them. For example, you might have a financial payment segment that should never share routes with a development segment, regardless of how many other share statements are created. Adding the payments segment to the deny-filter parameter prevents any shared routes from being created with other segments.
