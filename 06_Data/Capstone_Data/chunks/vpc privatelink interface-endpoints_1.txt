Select or deselect Availability Zones as needed. For each Availability Zone, select one subnet. By default, we select IP addresses from the subnet IP address ranges and assign them to the endpoint network interfaces. To choose the IP addresses for an endpoint network interface, select Designate IP addresses and enter an IPv4 address from the subnet address range. If the endpoint service supports IPv6, you can also enter an IPv6 address from the subnet address range. If you specify an IP address for a subnet that already has an endpoint network interface for this VPC endpoint, we replace the endpoint network interface with a new one. This processes temporarily disconnects the subnet and the VPC endpoint.Choose Modify subnets.To change the subnets using the command linemodify-vpc-endpoint (AWS CLI)Edit-EC2VpcEndpoint (Tools for Windows PowerShell)Associate security groups
