Although IPAM doesn't monitor Amazon EC2 instances or EC2 network interfaces attached to instances, you can use the Search IP history feature to search for historical data on EC2 instance and network interface CIDRs.NoteThe commands in this tutorial must be run using the account that owns the IPAM and the AWS Region that hosts the IPAM.Records of changes to CIDRs are picked up in periodic snapshots, which means that it can take some time for records to appear or be updated, and the values for SampledStartTime and SampledEndTime can differ from the actual times they occurred.ScenariosThe scenarios in this section show you how to analyze and audit IP address usage using the AWS CLI. For more information about the values mentioned in this tutorial like sampled end time and start time, see View IP address history.
