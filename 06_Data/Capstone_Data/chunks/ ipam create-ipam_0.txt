If you have delegated an IPAM administrator, these steps should be completed by the IPAM account.ImportantWhen you create an IPAM, you will be asked to allow IPAM to replicate data from source accounts into an IPAM delegate account. To integrate IPAM with AWS Organizations, IPAM needs your permission to replicate resource and IP usage details across accounts (from member accounts to the delegated IPAM member account) and across AWS Regions (from operating Regions to the home Region of your IPAM). For single account IPAM users, IPAM needs your permission to replicate resource and IP usage details across operating Regions to the home Region of your IPAM.
