Choose Actions, Edit routes.Choose Add route.For Destination, enter the IPv4 address range to which the network traffic in the VPC peering connection must be directed. You can specify the entire IPv4 CIDR block of the peer VPC, a specific range, or an individual IPv4 address, such as the IP address of the instance with which to communicate. For example, if the CIDR block of the peer VPC is 10.0.0.0/16, you can specify a portion 10.0.0.0/24, or a specific IP address 10.0.0.7/32.For Target, select the VPC peering connection.Choose Save changes.The owner of the peer VPC must also complete these steps to add a route to direct traffic back to your VPC through the VPC peering connection.If you have resources in different AWS Regions that use IPv6 addresses, you can create an inter-Region peering connection. You can then add an IPv6 route for communication between the resources.
