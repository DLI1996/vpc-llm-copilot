If there are multiple reachable paths between a source and a destination, Reachability Analyzer identifies and displays the shortest path. You can analyze the path again, specifying an intermediate component, to find an alternative reachable path that traverses the intermediate component.If the path is not reachable, Reachability Analyzer displays information about the component or combination of components that is blocking the path. There might be additional components blocking the path.ContentsSource and destination resourcesIntermediate componentsPath componentsConsiderationsResource configurationSource and destination resources
