For DHCP options, provide the configuration settings that you need. Domain name (optional): Enter the domain name that a client should use when resolving hostnames via the Domain Name System. If you are not using AmazonProvidedDNS, your custom domain name servers must resolve the hostname as appropriate. If you use an Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone, you can use AmazonProvidedDNS. For more information, see DNS attributes for your VPC. Some Linux operating systems accept multiple domain names separated by spaces. However, other Linux operating systems and Windows treat the value as a single domain, which results in unexpected behavior. If your DHCP option set is associated with a VPC that contains instances that are not all running the same operating systems, specify only one domain name.
