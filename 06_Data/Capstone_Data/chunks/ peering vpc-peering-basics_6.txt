Active: The VPC peering connection is active, and traffic can flow between the VPCs (provided that your security groups and route tables allow the flow of traffic). While in this state, either of the VPC owners can delete the VPC peering connection, but cannot reject it. NoteIf an event in a region in which a VPC resides prevents the flow of traffic, the status of the VPC peering connection remains Active.Deleting: Applies to an inter-Region VPC peering connection that is in the process of being deleted. The owner of either VPC has submitted a request to delete an active VPC peering connection, or the owner of the requester VPC has submitted a request to delete a pending-acceptance VPC peering connection request.
