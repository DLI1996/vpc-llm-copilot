You can create a Transit Gateway Connect attachment to establish a connection between a transit gateway and third-party virtual appliances (such as SD-WAN appliances) running in a VPC. A Connect attachment supports the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel protocol for high performance, and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for dynamic routing. After you create a Connect attachment, you can create one or more GRE tunnels (also referred to as Transit Gateway Connect peers) on the Connect attachment to connect the transit gateway and the third-party appliance. You establish two BGP sessions over the GRE tunnel to exchange routing information.Important
