The tcp-flags field in the examples in this section are represented by the second-to-last value in the flow log. TCP flags can help you identify the direction of the traffic, for example, which server initiated the connection.NoteFor more information about the tcp-flags option and an explanation of each of the TCP flags, see Available fields.In the following records (starting at 7:47:55 PM and ending at 7:48:53 PM), two connections were started by a client to a server running on port 5001. Two SYN flags (2) were received by server from the client from different source ports on the client (43416 and 43418). For each SYN, a SYN-ACK was sent from the server to the client (18) on the corresponding port.
