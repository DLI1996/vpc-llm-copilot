A Network Access Scope defines outbound and inbound traffic patterns, including sources, destinations, paths, and traffic types. Each Network Access Scope consists of one or more match conditions, and zero or more exclusion conditions.When you start an analysis on a Network Access Scope, Network Access Analyzer produces findings. It identifies network paths in the Network Access Scope that match at least one of the match conditions, and none of the exclude conditions. By combining match and exclude conditions, you can refine the findings produced by Network Access Analyzer to identify unexpected connectivity in your network.
