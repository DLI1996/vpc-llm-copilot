If at least one of the attributes is set to false, the following occurs: Instances with public IP addresses do not receive corresponding public DNS hostnames. The Amazon Route 53 Resolver cannot resolve Amazon-provided private DNS hostnames. Instances receive custom private DNS hostnames if there is a custom domain name in the DHCP options set. If you are not using the Amazon Route 53 Resolver server, your custom domain name servers must resolve the hostname as appropriate.
