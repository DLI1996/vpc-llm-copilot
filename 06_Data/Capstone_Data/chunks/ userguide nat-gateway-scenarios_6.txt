If you can connect to the internet, you can also test whether internet traffic is routed through the NAT gateway:Trace the route of traffic from an instance in your private subnet. To do this, run the traceroute command from a Linux instance in your private subnet. In the output, you should see the private IP address of the NAT gateway in one of the hops (usually the first hop).Use a third-party website or tool that displays the source IP address when you connect to it from an instance in your private subnet. The source IP address should be the elastic IP address of the NAT gateway.If these tests fail, see Troubleshoot NAT gateways.Test the internet connectionThe following example demonstrates how to test whether an instance in a private subnet can connect to the internet.
