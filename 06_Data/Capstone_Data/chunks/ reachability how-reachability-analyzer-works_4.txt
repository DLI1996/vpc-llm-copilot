Reachability Analyzer supports shared resources only if they can be fully described by the calling principal. For example, if a route references a prefix list owned by another account, the owner must share the prefix list with the calling principal for the analysis to succeed.If you enable trusted access, the delegated administrator account can create and delete paths that traverse owner and participant subnets within your organization from AWS Organizations. This account can also start and delete path analyses. For more information, see Cross-account analyses for Reachability Analyzer.Paths are not a shareable resource.Transit gateway Connect attachments are not supported. Reachability Analyzer analyzes connectivity only up to these attachments.With the TCP protocol, when a network path traverses a transit gateway route table, only forward traffic is analyzed.
