The following diagram shows the key components of the configuration for this scenario. The transit gateway has three VPC attachments. VPC C is a shared services VPC. Traffic between VPC A and VPC B is routed to the transit gateway, then routed to a security appliance in VPC C for inspection before it's routed to the final destination. The appliance is a stateful appliance, therefore both the request and response traffic is inspected. For high availability, there is an appliance in each Availability Zone in VPC C.You create the following resources for this scenario:Three VPCs.
