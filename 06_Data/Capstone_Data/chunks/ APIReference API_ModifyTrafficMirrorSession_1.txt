The number of bytes in each packet to mirror. These are bytes after the VXLAN header. To mirror a subset, set this to the length (in bytes) to mirror. For example, if you set this value to 100, then the first 100 bytes that meet the filter criteria are copied to the target. Do not specify this parameter when you want to mirror the entire packet.
