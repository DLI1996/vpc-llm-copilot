Under Service, choose EC2 (EIP/VPC). The service you select determines the AWS service where the CIDR will be advertisable. Currently, the only option is EC2 (EIP/VPC), which means that the CIDRs allocated from this pool will be advertisable for the Amazon EC2 service (for Elastic IP addresses) and the Amazon VPC service (for CIDRs associated with VPCs).Under CIDRs to provision, choose a CIDR to provision for the pool. Note that when provisioning an IPv6 CIDR to a pool within the top-level pool, the minimum IPv6 CIDR you can provision for an advertisable IPAM pool is /48; more specific CIDRs (such as /49) are not permitted. The minimum CIDR you can bring in for an non-advertisable IPAM pool is /56; more specific CIDRs (such as /57) are not permitted.
