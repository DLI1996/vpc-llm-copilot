Gateway endpoints support only IPv4 traffic.The source IPv4 addresses from instances in your affected subnets change from public IPv4 addresses to private IPv4 addresses from your VPC. An endpoint switches network routes and disconnects open TCP connections. The previous connections that used public IPv4 addresses are not resumed. We recommend that you do not have any critical tasks running when you create or modify a gateway endpoint. Alternatively, test to ensure that your software can automatically reconnect to DynamoDB if a connection breaks.Endpoint connections cannot be extended out of a VPC. Resources on the other side of a VPN connection, VPC peering connection, transit gateway, or AWS Direct Connect connection in your VPC cannot use a gateway endpoint to communicate with DynamoDB.
