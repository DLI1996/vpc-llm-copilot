If an interface VPC endpoint supports IPv4, the endpoint network interfaces have IPv4 addresses. If an interface VPC endpoint supports IPv6, the endpoint network interfaces have IPv6 addresses. The IPv6 address for an endpoint network interface is unreachable from the internet. If you describe an endpoint network interface with an IPv6 address, notice that denyAllIgwTraffic is enabled.Requirements to enable IPv6 for an endpoint serviceThe VPC and subnets for the endpoint service must have associated IPv6 CIDR blocks.All Network Load Balancers for the endpoint service must use the dualstack IP address type. The targets do not need to support IPv6 traffic. If the service processes source IP addresses from the proxy protocol version 2 header, it must process IPv6 addresses.Requirements to enable IPv6 for an interface endpointThe endpoint service must support IPv6 requests.
