If you launch an instance into your subnet after you create a flow log for your subnet or VPC, we create a log stream (for CloudWatch Logs) or log file object (for Amazon S3) for the new network interface as soon as there is network traffic for the network interface.You can create flow logs for network interfaces that are created by other AWS services, such as:Elastic Load BalancingAmazon RDSAmazon ElastiCacheAmazon RedshiftAmazon WorkSpacesNAT gatewaysTransit gatewaysRegardless of the type of network interface, you must use the Amazon EC2 console or the Amazon EC2 API to create a flow log for a network interface.You can apply tags to your flow logs. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tags can help you organize your flow logs, for example by purpose or owner.
