When you disassociate a resource discovery from an IPAM, the IPAM no longer monitors all resources CIDRs and accounts discovered under the resource discovery.NoteYou cannot disassociate a default resource discovery association. A default resource discovery association is one that is created automatically when you create an IPAM. The default resource discovery association is deleted, however, if you delete the IPAM.This step must be completed by the Primary Org IPAM Account. For more information about the roles involved in this process, see Process overview.
