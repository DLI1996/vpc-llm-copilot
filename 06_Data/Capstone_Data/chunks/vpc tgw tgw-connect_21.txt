(Optional) For Peer ASN, specify the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the appliance. You can use an existing ASN assigned to your network. If you do not have one, you can use a private ASN in the 64512–65534 (16-bit ASN) or 4200000000–4294967294 (32-bit ASN) range. The default is the same ASN as the transit gateway. If you configure the Peer ASN to be different than the transit gateway ASN (eBGP), you must configure ebgp-multihop with a time-to-live (TTL) value of 2.Choose Create connect peer.To create a Connect peer using the AWS CLIUse the create-transit-gateway-connect-peer command.View your Connect attachments and Connect peersYou can view your Connect attachments and Connect peers.To view your Connect attachments and Connect peers using the console
