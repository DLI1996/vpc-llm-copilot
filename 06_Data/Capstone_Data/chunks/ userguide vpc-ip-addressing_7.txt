We refer to private IP addresses as the IP addresses that are within the IPv4 CIDR range of the VPC. Most VPC IP address ranges fall within the private (non-publicly routable) IP address ranges specified in RFC 1918; however, you can use publicly routable CIDR blocks for your VPC. Regardless of the IP address range of your VPC, we do not support direct access to the internet from your VPC's CIDR block, including a publicly-routable CIDR block. You must set up internet access through a gateway; for example, an internet gateway, virtual private gateway, a AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect.We never advertise the IPv4 address range of a subnet to the internet.Public IPv4 addresses
