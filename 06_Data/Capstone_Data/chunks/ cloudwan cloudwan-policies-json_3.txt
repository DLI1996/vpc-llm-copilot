inside-cidr-blocks â€” (Optional) The Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block range used to create tunnels for AWS Transit Gateway Connect. The format is standard AWS CIDR range (for example, 10.0.1.0/24). You can optionally define the inside CIDR in the Core Network Edges section per Region. The minimum is a /24 for IPv4 or /64 for IPv6. You can provide multiple /24 subnets or a larger CIDR range. If you define a larger CIDR range, new Core Network Edges will be automatically assigned /24 and /64 subnets from the larger CIDR. an Inside CIDR block is required for attaching Connect attachments to a Core Network Edge.
