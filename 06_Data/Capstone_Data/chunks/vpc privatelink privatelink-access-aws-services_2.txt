The following diagram shows how instances access AWS services through AWS PrivateLink. First, you create an interface VPC endpoint, which establishes connections between the subnets in your VPC and an AWS service using network interfaces. Traffic destined for the AWS service is resolved to the private IP addresses of the endpoint network interfaces using DNS, and then sent to the AWS service using the connection between the VPC endpoint and the AWS service.AWS services accept connection requests automatically. The service can't initiate requests to resources through the VPC endpoint.DNS hostnamesMost AWS services offer public Regional endpoints, which have the following syntax.For example, the public endpoint for Amazon CloudWatch in us-east-2 is as follows.
