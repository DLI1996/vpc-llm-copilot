When you publish to Kinesis Data Firehose, you can choose a delivery stream that's in the same account as the resource to monitor (the source account), or in a different account (the destination account). To enable cross account delivery of flow logs to Kinesis Data Firehose, you must create an IAM role in the source account and an IAM role in the destination account.RolesSource account roleDestination account roleSource account role
