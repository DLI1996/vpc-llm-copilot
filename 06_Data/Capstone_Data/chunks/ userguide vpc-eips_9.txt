If you don't have Local Zones or Wavelength Zones enabled, when you allocate an EIP, the network border group that represents all of the AZs for the Region (such as us-west-2) is predefined for you and you cannot change it. This means that the EIP that you allocate to this network border group will be advertised in all AZs in the Region you're in.
