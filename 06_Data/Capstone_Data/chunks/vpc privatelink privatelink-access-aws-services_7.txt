Amazon provides a DNS server for your VPC, called the Route 53 Resolver. The Route 53 Resolver automatically resolves local VPC domain names and record in private hosted zones. However, you can't use the Route 53 Resolver from outside your VPC. If you'd like to access your VPC endpoint from your on-premises network, you can use Route 53 Resolver endpoints and Resolver rules. For more information, see Integrating AWS Transit Gateway with AWS PrivateLink and Amazon Route 53 Resolver.Subnets and Availability ZonesYou can configure your VPC endpoint with one subnet per Availability Zone. We create an endpoint network interface for the VPC endpoint in your subnet. We assign IP addresses to each endpoint network interface from its subnet, based on the IP address type of the VPC endpoint. The IP addresses of an endpoint network interface will not change during the lifetime of its VPC endpoint.
