InvalidTransfer.AddressCustomPtrSet: If you or someone in your organization has configured the Elastic IP address that you are attempting to transfer to use reverse DNS lookup, the source account can enable transfer for the Elastic IP address, but this exception occurs when the transfer account tries to accept the transfer. To resolve this issue, the source account must remove the DNS record for the Elastic IP address. For more information, see Remove a reverse DNS record in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
