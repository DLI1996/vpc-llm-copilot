In this scenario, your AWS network consists of three transit gateways. You own transit gateways tgw-1 and tgw-3. Transit gateway tgw-1 has a peering attachment with transit gateway tgw-2 that's in a different AWS account. Your entire network is within AWS, and does not consist of on-premises resources.For this scenario, do the following in Network Manager:Create a global network. For more information, see Create a global network.Register the transit gateways tgw-1 and tgw-3 with your global network. For more information, see Register a transit gateway.When you register tgw-1, the transit gateway peering attachment is included in the global network, and you can see information about tgw-2. However, any attachments for tgw-2 are not included in your global network. To see attachments for tgw-2, you must enable multi-account access.
