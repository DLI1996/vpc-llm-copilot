You might need to verify your domain more than once because you're supporting multiple Regions or multiple AWS accounts. If your DNS provider doesn't allow you to have more than one TXT record with the same attribute name, check whether your DNS provider allows you to assign multiple attribute values to the same TXT record. For example, if your DNS is managed by Amazon Route 53, you can use the following procedure. In the Route 53 console, choose the TXT record that you created when you verified your domain in the first Region. For Value, go to the end of the existing attribute value, and then press Enter. Add the attribute value for the additional Region, and then save the record set.
