Custom network ACLs and other AWS servicesIf you create a custom network ACL, be aware of how it might affect resources that you create using other AWS services.With Elastic Load Balancing, if the subnet for your backend instances has a network ACL in which you've added a deny rule for all traffic with a source of either 0.0.0.0/0 or the subnet's CIDR, your load balancer can't carry out health checks on the instances. For more information about the recommended network ACL rules for your load balancers and backend instances, see Network ACLs for Load Balancers in a VPC in the User Guide for Classic Load Balancers.Ephemeral portsThe example network ACL in the preceding section uses an ephemeral port range of 32768-65535. However, you might want to use a different range for your network ACLs depending on the type of client that you're using or with which you're communicating.
