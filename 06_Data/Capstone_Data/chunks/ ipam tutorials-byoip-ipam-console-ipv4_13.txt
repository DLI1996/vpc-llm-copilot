Under Service, choose EC2 (EIP/VPC). The service you select determines the AWS service where the CIDR will be advertisable. Currently, the only option is EC2 (EIP/VPC), which means that the CIDRs allocated from this pool will be advertisable for the Amazon EC2 service (for Elastic IP addresses) and the Amazon VPC service (for CIDRs associated with VPCs).Under CIDRs to provision, choose a CIDR to provision for the pool. Note that when provisioning a CIDR to a pool within the top-level pool, the minimum IPv4 CIDR you can provision is /24; more specific CIDRs (such as /25) are not permitted.
