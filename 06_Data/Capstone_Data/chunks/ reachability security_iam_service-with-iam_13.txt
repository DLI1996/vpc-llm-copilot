ABAC is helpful in environments that are growing rapidly and helps with situations where policy management becomes cumbersome.To control access based on tags, you provide tag information in the condition element of a policy using the aws:ResourceTag/key-name, aws:RequestTag/key-name, or aws:TagKeys condition keys.If a service supports all three condition keys for every resource type, then the value is Yes for the service. If a service supports all three condition keys for only some resource types, then the value is Partial.For more information about ABAC, see What is ABAC? in the IAM User Guide.
