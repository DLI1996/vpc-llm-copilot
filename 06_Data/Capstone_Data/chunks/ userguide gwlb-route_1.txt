The middlebox routing wizard, automatically performs the following operations:Creates the route tables.Adds the necessary routes to the new route tables.Disassociates the current route tables associated with the subnets.Associates the route tables that the middlebox routing wizard creates with the subnets.Creates a tag that indicates it was created by the middlebox routing wizard, and a tag that indicates the creation date.The middlebox routing wizard does not modify your existing route tables. It creates new route tables, and then associates them with your gateway and subnet resources. If your resources are already explicitly associated with existing route tables, the existing route tables are first disassociated, and then the new route tables are associated with your resources. Your existing route tables are not deleted.
