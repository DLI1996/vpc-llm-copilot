When you attach a VPC to a transit gateway, any resources in Availability Zones where there is no transit gateway attachment cannot reach the transit gateway. If there is a route to the transit gateway in a subnet route table, traffic is forwarded to the transit gateway only when the transit gateway has an attachment in a subnet in the same Availability Zone.The resources in a VPC attached to a transit gateway cannot access the security groups of a different VPC that is also attached to the same transit gateway.A transit gateway does not support DNS resolution for custom DNS names of attached VPCs set up using private hosted zones in Amazon Route 53. To configure name resolution for private hosted zones for all VPCs attached to a transit gateway, see Centralized DNS management of hybrid cloud with Amazon Route 53 and AWS Transit Gateway.
