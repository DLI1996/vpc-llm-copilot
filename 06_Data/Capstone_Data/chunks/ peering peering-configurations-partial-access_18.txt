In this configuration, there is a central VPC (VPC A) with one subnet, a peering connection between VPC A and VPC B (pcx-aaaabbbb), and a peering connection between VPC A and VPC C (pcx-aaaacccc). VPC B and VPC C have matching CIDR blocks. You use VPC peering connection pcx-aaaabbbb to route traffic between VPC A and a specific instance in VPC B. All other traffic destined for the CIDR address range shared by VPC B and VPC C is routed to VPC C through pcx-aaaacccc.VPC route tables use longest prefix match to select the most specific route across the intended VPC peering connection. All other traffic is routed through the next matching route, in this case, across the VPC peering connection pcx-aaaacccc.
