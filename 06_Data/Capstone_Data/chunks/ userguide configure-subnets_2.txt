The subnet type is determined by how you configure routing for your subnets. For example:Public subnet – The subnet has a direct route to an internet gateway. Resources in a public subnet can access the public internet.Private subnet – The subnet does not have a direct route to an internet gateway. Resources in a private subnet require a NAT device to access the public internet.VPN-only subnet – The subnet has a route to a Site-to-Site VPN connection through a virtual private gateway. The subnet does not have a route to an internet gateway.Isolated subnet – The subnet has no routes to destinations outside its VPC. Resources in an isolated subnet can only access or be accessed by other resources in the same VPC.Subnet diagram
