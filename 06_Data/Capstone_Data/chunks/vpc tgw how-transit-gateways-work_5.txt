ECMP is not supported between different attachment types. For example, you can't enable ECMP between a VPN and a VPC attachment. Instead, transit gateway routes are evaluated and traffic routed accordingly to the evaluated route. For more information, see Route evaluation order.A single Direct Connect gateway supports ECMP across multiple transit virtual interfaces. Therefore, we recommended that you set up and use only a single Direct Connect gateway and to not set up and use multiple gateways to take advantage of ECMP. For more information about Direct Connect gateways and public virtual interfaces, see How do I set up an Active/Active or Active/Passive Direct Connect connection to AWS from a public virtual interface?.Availability Zones
