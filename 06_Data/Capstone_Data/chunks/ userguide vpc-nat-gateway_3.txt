Both private and public NAT gateways map the source private IPv4 address of the instances to the private IPv4 address of the NAT gateway, but in the case of a public NAT gateway, the internet gateway then maps the private IPv4 address of the public NAT Gateway to the Elastic IP address associated with the NAT Gateway. When sending response traffic to the instances, whether it's a public or private NAT gateway, the NAT gateway translates the address back to the original source IP address.ImportantYou can use either a public or private NAT gateway to route traffic to transit gateways and virtual private gateways.If you use a private NAT gateway to connect to a transit gateway or virtual private gateway, traffic to the destination will come from the private IP address of the private NAT gateway.
