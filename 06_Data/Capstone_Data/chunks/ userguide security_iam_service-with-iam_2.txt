The Action element of a JSON policy describes the actions that you can use to allow or deny access in a policy. Policy actions usually have the same name as the associated AWS API operation. There are some exceptions, such as permission-only actions that don't have a matching API operation. There are also some operations that require multiple actions in a policy. These additional actions are called dependent actions.Include actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.Amazon VPC shares its API namespace with Amazon EC2. Policy actions in Amazon VPC use the following prefix before the action: ec2:. For example, to grant a user permission to create a VPC using the CreateVpc API operation, you grant access to the ec2:CreateVpc action. Policy statements must include either an Action or NotAction element.
