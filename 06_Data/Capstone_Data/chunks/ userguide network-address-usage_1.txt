Peered Network Address Usage – The maximum number of NAU units for a VPC and all of its peered VPCs. If a VPC is peered with other VPCs in the same Region, the VPCs combined can have up to 128,000 NAU units by default. You can request a quota increase up to 512,000. VPCs that are peered across different Regions do not contribute to this limit.You can use the NAU in the following ways:Before you create your virtual network, calculate the NAU units to help you decide if you should spread workloads across multiple VPCs.After you’ve created your VPC, use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the NAU usage of the VPC so that it doesn't grow beyond the NAU quota limits. For more information, see CloudWatch metrics for your VPCs.How NAU is calculatedIf you understand how NAU is calculated, it can help you plan for the scaling of your VPCs.
