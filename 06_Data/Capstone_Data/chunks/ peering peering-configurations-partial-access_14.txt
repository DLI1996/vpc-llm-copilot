To prevent this, you can add a specific route to the VPC A route table with the CIDR of subnet 2 in VPC B as the destination and a target of pcx-aaaabbbb. The new route is more specific, therefore traffic destined for the subnet 2 CIDR is routed to the VPC peering connection pcx-aaaabbbbAlternatively, in the following example, the VPC A route table has a route for each subnet for each VPC peering connection. VPC A can communicate with subnet B in VPC B and with subnet A in VPC C. This scenario is useful if you need to add another VPC peering connection with another subnet that falls within the same address range as VPC B and VPC C â€”you can simply add another route for that specific subnet.
