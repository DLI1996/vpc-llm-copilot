Each IPv4 address can support up to 55,000 simultaneous connections to each unique destination. A unique destination is identified by a unique combination of destination IP address, the destination port, and protocol (TCP/UDP/ICMP). You can increase this limit by associating up to 8 IPv4 addresses to your NAT Gateways (1 primary IPv4 address and 7 secondary IPv4 addresses). You are limited to associating 2 Elastic IP addresses to your public NAT gateway by default. You can increase this limit by requesting a quota adjustment. For more information, see Elastic IP addresses.You can use the NAT gateway CloudWatch metrics ErrorPortAllocation and PacketsDropCount to determine if your NAT gateway is generating port allocation errors or dropping packets. To resolve this issue, add secondary IPv4 addresses to your NAT gateway.Considerations
