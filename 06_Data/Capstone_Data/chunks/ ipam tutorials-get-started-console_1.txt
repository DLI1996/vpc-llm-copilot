This tutorial covers integrating IPAM with accounts in an organization. It does not cover how to Integrate IPAM with accounts outside of your organization.NoteFor the purposes of this tutorial, the instructions will tell you to name IPAM resources in a particular way, create IPAM resources in specific Regions, and use specific IP address CIDR ranges for your pools.
