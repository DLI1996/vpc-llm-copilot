When you delegate an Organizations member account as an IPAM account, IPAM automatically creates a service-linked IAM role in all member accounts in your organization. IPAM monitors the IP address usage in these accounts by assuming the service-linked IAM role in each member account, discovering the resources and their CIDRs, and integrating them with IPAM. The resources within all member accounts will be discoverable by IPAM regardless of their Organizational Unit. If there are member accounts that have created a VPC, for example, youâ€™ll see the VPC and its CIDR in the Resources section of the IPAM console.ImportantThe role of the AWS Organizations management account that delegated the IPAM admin is now complete. To continue using IPAM, the IPAM admin account must log into Amazon VPC IPAM and create an IPAM.Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.
