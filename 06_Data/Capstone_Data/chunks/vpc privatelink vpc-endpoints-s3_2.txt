If you're using the Amazon DNS servers, you must enable both DNS hostnames and DNS resolution for your VPC. If you're using your own DNS server, ensure that requests to Amazon S3 resolve correctly to the IP addresses maintained by AWS.Check whether you are using an AWS service that requires access to an S3 bucket. For example, a service might require access to buckets that contain log files, or might require you to download drivers or agents to your EC2 instances. If so, ensure that your endpoint policy allows the AWS service or resource to access these buckets using the s3:GetObject action.
