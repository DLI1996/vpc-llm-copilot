An EC2 instance in a IPv6-only subnet can retrieve its IPv6 address from the IPv6 DHCP server and can retrieve additional networking configuration information, such as DNS server names and domain names.The Amazon DHCP servers can also provide an entire IPv4 or IPv6 prefix to a network interface in your VPC using prefix delegation (see Assigning prefixes to Amazon EC2 network interfaces in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances). IPv4 prefix delegation is not provided in DHCP responses. IPv4 prefixes assigned to the interface can be retrieved using IMDS (see Instance metadata categories in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances).Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
