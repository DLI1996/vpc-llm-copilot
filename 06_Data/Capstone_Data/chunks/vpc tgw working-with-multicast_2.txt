Multicast source — An elastic network interface associated with a supported EC2 instance that is statically configured to send multicast traffic. A multicast source only applies to static source configurations. A static source multicast domain contains hosts that do not use the IGMP protocol to join, leave, and send messages. You use the AWS CLI to add a source and group members. The statically-added source sends multicast traffic and the members receive multicast traffic.Multicast group member — An elastic network interface associated with a supported EC2 instance that receives multicast traffic. A multicast group has multiple group members. In a static source group membership configuration, multicast group members can only receive traffic. In an IGMP group configuration, members can both send and receive traffic.Considerations
