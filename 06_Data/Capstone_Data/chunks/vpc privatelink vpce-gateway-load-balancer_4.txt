The IP address type of a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint must be compatible with the subnet for the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, as described here: IPv4 – Assign IPv4 addresses to your endpoint network interfaces. This option is supported only if all selected subnets have IPv4 address ranges. IPv6 – Assign IPv6 addresses to your endpoint network interfaces. This option is supported only if all selected subnets are IPv6 only subnets. Dualstack – Assign both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to your endpoint network interfaces. This option is supported only if all selected subnets have both IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges.The route tables for the subnets in the service consumer VPC must route IPv6 traffic and the network ACLs for these subnets must allow IPv6 traffic.Routing
