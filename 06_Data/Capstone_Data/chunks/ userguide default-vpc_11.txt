You can delete a default subnet or default VPC just as you can delete any other subnet or VPC. However, if you delete your default subnets or default VPC, you must explicitly specify a subnet in one of your VPCs when you launch instances. If you do not have another VPC, you must create a VPC with a subnet in at least one Availability Zone. For more information, see Create a VPC.If you delete your default VPC, you can create a new one. For more information, see Create a default VPC.If you delete a default subnet, you can create a new one. For more information, see Create a default subnet. To ensure that your new default subnet behaves as expected, modify the subnet attribute to assign public IP addresses to instances that are launched in that subnet. For more information, see Modify the public IPv4 addressing attribute for your subnet. You can only have one default subnet per Availability Zone. You cannot create a default subnet in a nondefault VPC.
