The following diagram shows how instances access Amazon S3 and DynamoDB through a gateway endpoint. Traffic from your VPC to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB is routed to the gateway endpoint. Each subnet route table must have a route that sends traffic destined for the service to the gateway endpoint using the prefix list for the service. For more information, see AWS-managed prefix lists in the Amazon VPC User Guide.RoutingWhen you create a gateway endpoint, you select the VPC route tables for the subnets that you enable. The following route is automatically added to each route table that you select. The destination is a prefix list for the service owned by AWS and the target is the gateway endpoint.prefix_list_id gateway_endpoint_idConsiderations
