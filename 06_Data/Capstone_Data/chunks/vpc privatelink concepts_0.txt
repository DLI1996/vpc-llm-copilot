You can launch AWS resources in your VPC. You can allow the resources in your VPC to connect to resources outside that VPC. For example, add an internet gateway to the VPC to allow access to the internet, or add a VPN connection to allow access to your on-premises network. Alternatively, use AWS PrivateLink to allow the resources in your VPC to connect to services in other VPCs using private IP addresses, as if those services were hosted directly in your VPC.The following are important concepts to understand as you get started using AWS PrivateLink.ContentsArchitecture diagramService providersService consumersAWS PrivateLink connectionsPrivate hosted zones
