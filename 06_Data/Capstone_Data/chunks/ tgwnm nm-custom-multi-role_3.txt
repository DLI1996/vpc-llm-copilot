When choosing the IAMRoleForAWSNetworkManagerCrossAccountResourceAccess permission, an associated administrative or read-only template is also passed to AWS CloudFormation StackSets. These templates contain a list of accounts that are able to assume these roles. These accounts include the AWS Organizations management account and all registered delegated administrators for the Network Manager service. Deregistering a delegated administrator removes it from this list so that it can no longer assume these roles. Disabling trusted access deletes the AWS CloudFormation StackSets, and in turn all member account stacks and custom IAM roles in those accounts that were StackSets-managed for multi-account.Template policies for IAMRoleForAWSNetworkManagerCrossAccountResourceAccess
