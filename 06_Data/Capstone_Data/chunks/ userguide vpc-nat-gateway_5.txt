If you have resources in multiple Availability Zones and they share one NAT gateway, and if the NAT gatewayâ€™s Availability Zone is down, resources in the other Availability Zones lose internet access. To improve resiliency, create a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone, and configure your routing to ensure that resources use the NAT gateway in the same Availability Zone.The following characteristics and rules apply to NAT gateways:A NAT gateway supports the following protocols: TCP, UDP, and ICMP.NAT gateways are supported for IPv4 or IPv6 traffic. For IPv6 traffic, NAT gateway performs NAT64. By using this in conjunction with DNS64 (available on Route 53 resolver), your IPv6 workloads in a subnet in Amazon VPC can communicate with IPv4 resources. These IPv4 services may be present in the same VPC (in a separate subnet) or a different VPC, on your on-premises environment or on the internet.
