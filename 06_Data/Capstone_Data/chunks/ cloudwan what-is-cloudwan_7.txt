Core Network Edge The Regional connection point managed by AWS in each Region, as defined in the core network policy. Every attachment connects to a Core Network Edge. Under the hood, this is an AWS Transit Gateway, and it inherits many of the same properties. In your core network policy document, you define the AWS Region where you want connectivity. At any time, you can add or remove AWS Regions using the policy document. For each AWS Region that you define in the policy document, AWS Cloud WAN then creates a Core Network Edge router in the specified Region. All Core Network Edges in your core network create full-mesh peering with each other to form a highly resilient network. Traffic across the AWS global network uses redundant connections and multiple paths.
