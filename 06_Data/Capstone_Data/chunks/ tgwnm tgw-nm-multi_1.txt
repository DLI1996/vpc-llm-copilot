AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways allows you to centrally manage, monitor, and visualize network resources from multiple accounts within an organization in a single global network. To manage resources from multiple accounts in global networks, you first set up an organization using AWS Organizations. The first account that you use to create an organization becomes the management account. Using this account, you can add other accounts as member accounts to your organization. From the management account, you can designate one or more accounts within the organization as delegated administrator accounts by registering them using the global networks console. For more information about setting up an organization, see Creating and managing an organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.
