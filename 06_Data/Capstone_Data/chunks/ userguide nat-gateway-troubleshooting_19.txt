You might have reached the limit for simultaneous connections for a single NAT gateway. For more information, see NAT gateway basics. If your instances in the private subnet create a large number of connections, you might reach this limit.SolutionDo one of the following:Create a NAT gateway per Availability Zone and spread your clients across those zones.Create additional NAT gateways in the public subnet and split your clients into multiple private subnets, each with a route to a different NAT gateway.Limit the number of connections your clients can create to the destination.Use the IdleTimeoutCount metric in CloudWatch to monitor for increases in idle connections. Close idle connections to release capacity.
