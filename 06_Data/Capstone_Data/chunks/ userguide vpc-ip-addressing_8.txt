All subnets have an attribute that determines whether a network interface created in the subnet automatically receives a public IPv4 address (also referred to as a public IP address in this topic). Therefore, when you launch an instance into a subnet that has this attribute enabled, a public IP address is assigned to the primary network interface (eth0) that's created for the instance. A public IP address is mapped to the primary private IP address through network address translation (NAT).You can control whether your instance receives a public IP address by doing the following:Modifying the public IP addressing attribute of your subnet. For more information, see Modify the public IPv4 addressing attribute for your subnet.Enabling or disabling the public IP addressing feature during instance launch, which overrides the subnet's public IP addressing attribute.
