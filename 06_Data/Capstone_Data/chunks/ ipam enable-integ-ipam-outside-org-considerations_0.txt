AWSDocumentationAmazon VPCIP Address ManagerConsiderations and limitationsThis section contains considerations and limitations for integrating IPAM with accounts outside of your organization:When you share a resource discovery with another account, the only data that is exchanged is IP address and account status monitoring data. You can view this data before sharing using the get-ipam-discovered-resource-cidrs and get-ipam-discovered-accounts CLI commands or GetIpamDiscoveredResourceCidrs and GetIpamDiscoveredAccounts APIs. For resource discoveries that monitor resources across an organization, no organization data (such as the names of Organizational Units in your organization) are shared.
