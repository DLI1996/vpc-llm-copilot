When you create a security group, you must provide it with a name and a description. The following rules apply: A security group name must be unique within the VPC. Names and descriptions can be up to 255 characters in length. Names and descriptions are limited to the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, spaces, and ._-:/()#,@[]+=&;{}!$*. When the name contains trailing spaces, we trim the space at the end of the name. For example, if you enter "Test Security Group " for the name, we store it as "Test Security Group". A security group name cannot start with sg-.
