When you create a resource discovery, the resource discovery monitors all visible resources in the owner account. If the owner account is a third-party service AWS account that creates resources for multiple of their own customers, those resources will be discovered by the resource discovery. If the third-party AWS service account shares the resource discovery with an end-user AWS account, the end-user will have visibility into the resources of the other customers of the third-party AWS service. For that reason, the third-party AWS service should exercise caution creating and sharing resource discoveries or use a separate AWS account for each customer.Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
