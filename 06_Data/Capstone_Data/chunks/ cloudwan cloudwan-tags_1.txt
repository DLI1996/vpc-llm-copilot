In a core network, all attachments use the attachment policy to map an attachment to a segment. Instead of manually associating a segment to each attachment, you can add tags to attachments. You can then use the tags to associate the attachments to the desired segment as defined in the attachment policies. For example, a tag on an attachment that's labeled “segment”:“development” would map to a “development” segment.To add or update attachment tagsAccess the Network Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.combetworkmanager/home/.Under Connectivity, choose Global Networks.
