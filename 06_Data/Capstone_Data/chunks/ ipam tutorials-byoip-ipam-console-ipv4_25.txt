Provision the public IPv4 CIDR to your public IPv4 pool. The value for --region must match the Locale value you chose when you created the pool that will be used for the BYOIP CIDR. The --netmask-length is the amount of space out of the IPAM pool that you want to bring to your public pool. The value cannot be larger than the netmask length of the IPAM pool. The least specific IPv4 prefix you can bring is /24.NoteIf you are bringing a /24 CIDR range to IPAM to share across an AWS Organization, you can provision smaller prefixes to multiple IPAM pools, say /27 (using -- netmask-length 27), rather than provisioning the entire /24 CIDR (using -- netmask-length 24) as is shown in this tutorial.This step must be done by the member account using the AWS CLI.To create a public IPv4 pool using the AWS CLI
