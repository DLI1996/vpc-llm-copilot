For short connections (for example, a few seconds) that are opened and closed within a single aggregation interval, the flags might be set on the same line in the flow log record for traffic flow in the same direction. In the following example, the connection is established and finished within the same aggregation interval. In the first line, the TCP flag value is 3, which indicates that there was a SYN and a FIN message sent from the client to the server. In the second line, the TCP flag value is 19, which indicates that there was SYN-ACK and a FIN message sent from the server to the client.Traffic through a NAT gatewayIn this example, an instance in a private subnet accesses the internet through a NAT gateway that's in a public subnet.
