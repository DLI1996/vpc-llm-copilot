Network Access Analyzer supports internet gateways and virtual private gateways at the beginning or end of a path, but does not report paths that pass through internet gateways or virtual private gateways. For example, Network Access Analyzer does not produce paths that start in one VPC, pass through the internet, and end in a second Amazon VPC after passing through an internet gateway. These resources are outside of AWS networking and therefore out of scope.Network Access Analyzer does not support NAT reflection at internet gateways. For example, Network Access Analyzer does not report network paths from one network interface to another network interface that are addressed to the second network interface's public IPV4 address.Application Load BalancersNetwork Access Analyzer does not support advanced forwarding rules.Gateway Load Balancers
