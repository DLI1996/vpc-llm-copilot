Requirements to enable IPv6 for an interface endpointThe AWS service must make its service endpoints available over IPv6. For more information, see View IPv6 support.The IP address type of an interface endpoint must be compatible with the subnets for the interface endpoint, as described here: IPv4 – Assign IPv4 addresses to your endpoint network interfaces. This option is supported only if all selected subnets have IPv4 address ranges. IPv6 – Assign IPv6 addresses to your endpoint network interfaces. This option is supported only if all selected subnets are IPv6 only subnets. Dualstack – Assign both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to your endpoint network interfaces. This option is supported only if all selected subnets have both IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges.
