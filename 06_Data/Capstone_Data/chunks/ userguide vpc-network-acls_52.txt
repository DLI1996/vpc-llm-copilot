If you accidentally make your security group rules too permissive, the network ACL in this example continues to permit access only from the specified IP address. For example, the following security group contains a rule that allows inbound SSH access from any IP address. However, if you associate this security group with an instance in a subnet that uses the network ACL, only other instances within the subnet and your remote computer can access the instance, because the network ACL rules deny other inbound traffic to the subnet.All traffic All All sg-1234567890abcdef0 All instances associated with this security group can communicate with each other. SSH TCP 22 0.0.0.0/0 Allows SSH access from any IP address.
