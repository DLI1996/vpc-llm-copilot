Member accounts in your organization with delegated administrator access are able to leverage service-linked roles and assume IAM roles for access across multiple accounts. Only member accounts that are part of your AWS Organizations can be registered as delegated administrators. Your organization can have up to ten registered delegated administrators. Before you register a delegated administrator, you must enable global networks trusted access for your organization. For more information, see Enable trusted access.ImportantUsing your AWS Organizations management account to manage your global network in global networks is not recommended because the required service-linked roles are not propagated to this account. For more information on service-linked roles, see AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways service-linked roles.Register delegated administrators
