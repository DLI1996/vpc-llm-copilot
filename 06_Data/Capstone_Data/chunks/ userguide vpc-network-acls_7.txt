Source. [Inbound rules only] The source of the traffic (CIDR range).Destination. [Outbound rules only] The destination for the traffic (CIDR range).Allow/Deny. Whether to allow or deny the specified traffic.If you add a rule using a command line tool or the Amazon EC2 API, the CIDR range is automatically modified to its canonical form. For example, if you specify 100.68.0.18/18 for the CIDR range, we create a rule with a 100.68.0.0/18 CIDR range.Default network ACLThe default network ACL is configured to allow all traffic to flow in and out of the subnets with which it is associated. Each network ACL also includes a rule whose rule number is an asterisk (*). This rule ensures that if a packet doesn't match any of the other numbered rules, it's denied. You can't modify or remove this rule.
