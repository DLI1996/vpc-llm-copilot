If you have a VPC peered with multiple VPCs that have overlapping or matching CIDR blocks, ensure that your route tables are configured to avoid sending response traffic from your VPC to the incorrect VPC. AWS does not support unicast reverse path forwarding in VPC peering connections that checks the source IP of packets and routes reply packets back to the source.For example, VPC A is peered with VPC B and VPC C. VPC B and VPC C have matching CIDR blocks, and their subnets have matching CIDR blocks. The route table for subnet 2 in VPC B points to the VPC peering connection pcx-aaaabbbb to access the VPC A subnet. The VPC A route table is configured to send traffic destined for the VPC CIDR to peering connection pcx-aaaaccccc.
