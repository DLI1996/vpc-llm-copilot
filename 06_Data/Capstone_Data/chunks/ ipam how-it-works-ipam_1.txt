A scope is the highest-level container within IPAM. An IPAM contains two default scopes. Each scope represents the IP space for a single network. The private scope is intended for all private space. The public scope is intended for all public space. Scopes enable you to reuse IP addresses across multiple unconnected networks without causing IP address overlap or conflict. Within a scope, you create IPAM pools.A pool is a collection of contiguous IP address ranges (or CIDRs). IPAM pools enable you to organize your IP addresses according to your routing and security needs. You can have multiple pools within a top-level pool. For example, if you have separate routing and security needs for development and production applications, you can create a pool for each. Within IPAM pools, you allocate CIDRs to AWS resources.
