If there is a NAT gateway, there is a NAT gateway resource with the number of network interfaces and Elastic IP addresses for the NAT gateway. If there is a gateway endpoint, there is a gateway endpoint resource with the name of the AWS service (Amazon S3 or Amazon DynamoDB) that you can connect to using the endpoint.
