Additionally, AWS supports managed policies for job functions that span multiple services. For example, the ReadOnlyAccess AWS managed policy provides read-only access to all AWS services and resources. When a service launches a new feature, AWS adds read-only permissions for new operations and resources. For a list and descriptions of job function policies, see AWS managed policies for job functions in the IAM User Guide.AWS managed policy: AmazonVPCReachabilityAnalyzerFullAccessPolicyProvides permissions to create, analyze, and delete paths, and to describe path resources, such as EC2 instances, firewalls, internet gateways, load balancers, NAT gateways, network interfaces, transit gateways, VPC endpoint services, VPC endpoints, VPC peering connections, and virtual private gateways.To view the permissions for this policy, see AmazonVPCReachabilityAnalyzerFullAccessPolicy in the AWS Managed Policy Reference.
