For a VPN attachment, you can enable or disable ECMP support using the console when creating or modifying a transit gateway. For all other attachment types, the following ECMP restrictions apply:VPC - VPC does not support ECMP since CIDR blocks cannot overlap. For example, you can't attach a VPC with a CIDR 10.1.0.0/16 with a second VPC using the same CIDR to a transit gateway, and then set up routing to load balance the traffic between them.
