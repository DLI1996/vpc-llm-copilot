require approval. You can also define explicit route filters to be applied before those routes can be attached to a segment. Each attachment connects to one segment. Each segment will create a dedicated routing domain. You can create multiple network segments within your global network. Resources connected to the same segment can only communicate within the segment. Optionally, resources in the same segment can be isolated from each other, with access only to shared services. With segments, AWS maintains a consistent configuration across AWS Regions for you, instead of you needing to synchronize configuration across every device in your network.
