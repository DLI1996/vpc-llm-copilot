Plan to divide each VPC into subnets based on your connectivity requirements. For example:If you have web servers that will receive traffic from clients on the internet, create a subnet for these servers in each Availability Zone.If you also have servers that will receive traffic only from other servers in the VPC, create a separate subnet for these servers in each Availability Zone.If you have servers that will receive traffic only through a VPN connection to your network, create a separate subnet for these servers in each Availability Zone.
