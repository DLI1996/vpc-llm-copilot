If you use the same middlebox in a multiple middlebox configuration within the same VPC, make sure that the middlebox is in the same hop position for both subnets.The appliance must be configured in a separate subnet from the source or destination subnet.You must disable source/destination checking on the appliance. For more information, see Changing the Source or Destination Checking in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.The route tables and routes that the middlebox routing wizard creates count toward your quotas. For more information, see Route tables.If you delete a resource, for example a network interface, the route table associations with the resource are removed. If the resource is a target, the route destination is set to blackhole. The route tables are not deleted.
