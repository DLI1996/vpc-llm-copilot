Traffic is routed from the transit gateway to the VPC endpoint. However, there is no route from the VPC endpoint to the transit gateway, so we might drop the response traffic.MISSING_TARGET_GROUP_ATTRIBUTESThe target group attributes for the target were missing, so the analysis could not consider them.PATH_THROUGH_GWLB_NOT_CHECKEDThe analysis does not consider that traffic entering the VPC endpoint is forwarded to a Gateway Load Balancer for inspection before exiting the VPC endpoint.RECOMMENDED_APPLIANCE_MODEThe transit gateway VPC attachment has appliance mode disabled, but traffic is inspected through a Network Firewall. We recommend that you enable appliance mode for the VPC attachment.UNIDIRECTIONAL_PATH_ANALYSIS_ONLY
