The following VPC attributes determine the DNS support provided for your VPC. If both attributes are enabled, an instance launched into the VPC receives a public DNS hostname if it is assigned a public IPv4 address or an Elastic IP address at creation. If you enable both attributes for a VPC that didn't previously have them both enabled, instances that were already launched into that VPC receive public DNS hostnames if they have a public IPv4 address or an Elastic IP address.To check whether these attributes are enabled for your VPC, see View and update DNS attributes for your VPC.
