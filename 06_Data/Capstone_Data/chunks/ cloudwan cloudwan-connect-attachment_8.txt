When the third-party appliance is in the same subnet as the VPC attachment, routes are dynamically exchanged using BGP with the core network edge. For the dataplane to function correctly, no VPC route table modifications are required except for adding the core network BGP addresses to establish BGP peering.The BGP IPv4 prefixes advertised by the core network edge to your third-party appliance will have the core network attachment's Elastic Network Interface's (ENI) IPv4 address as the next-hop address, which differs from the core network BGP address peering.The BGP IPv6 prefixes advertised by the core network edge to your third-party appliance will use the EUI-64 Address of the core network attachment's ENI as the next-hop.
