A packet header statement defines the traffic types for a match or exclude condition. If you omit the packet header statement, all traffic types match. All fields are optional, but if you use a packet header statement, you must use at least one of its fields.You can specify the following fields:Protocols – The protocol strings to match. The possible values are tcp and udp. You can specify one of the values or both of the values. If you omit this field, packets with either the tcp or udp protocol are admitted.SourceAddress – The IP addresses or CIDR ranges. You can't specify this option with SourcePrefixLists. If specified, only packets with matching source addresses are admitted. If you don't specify SourcePrefixLists or SourceAddresses, packets with any source address are admitted.
