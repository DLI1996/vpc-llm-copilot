A stale security group rule is a rule that references a deleted security group in the same VPC or in a peer VPC, or that references a security group in a peer VPC for which the VPC peering connection has been deleted. When a security group rule becomes stale, it's not automatically removed from your security groupâ€”you must manually remove it. If a security group rule is stale because the VPC peering connection was deleted, the rule will no longer be marked as stale if you create a new VPC peering connection with the same VPCs.You can view and delete the stale security group rules for a VPC using the Amazon VPC console.To view and delete stale security group rulesOpen the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.In the navigation pane, choose Security groups.Choose Actions, Manage stale rules.For VPC, choose the VPC with the stale rules.Choose Edit.
