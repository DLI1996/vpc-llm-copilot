If your account was created after December 4, 2013, it comes with a default VPC in each Region. A default VPC is configured and ready for you to use. For example, it has a default subnet in each Availability Zone in the Region, an attached internet gateway, a route in the main route table that sends all traffic to the internet gateway, and DNS settings that automatically assign public DNS hostnames to instances with public IP addresses and enable DNS resolution through the Amazon-provided DNS server (see DNS attributes in your VPC). Therefore, an EC2 instance that is launched in a default subnet automatically has access to the internet. If you have a default VPC in a Region and you don't specify a subnet when you launch an EC2 instance into that Region, we choose one of the default subnets and launch the instance into that subnet.
