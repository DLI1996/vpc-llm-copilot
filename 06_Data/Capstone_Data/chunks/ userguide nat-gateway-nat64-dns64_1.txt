Your IPv6-only workloads running in VPCs can only send and receive IPv6 network packets. Without DNS64, a DNS query for an IPv4-only service will yield an IPv4 destination address in response and your IPv6-only service cannot communicate with it. To bridge this communication gap, you can enable DNS64 for a subnet and it applies to all the AWS resources within that subnet. With DNS64, the Amazon Route 53 Resolver looks up the DNS record for the service you queried for and does one of the following:If the record contains an IPv6 address, it returns the original record and the connection is established without any translation over IPv6.
