VPC CIDR Local 0.0.0.0/0 vgw-idExample 2: Replacing the main route tableYou might want to make changes to the main route table. To avoid any disruption to your traffic, we recommend that you first test the route changes using a custom route table. After you're satisfied with the testing, you can replace the main route table with the new custom table.The following diagram shows two subnets and two route tables. Subnet A is implicitly associated with route table A, the main route table. Subnet B is implicitly associated with route table A. Route table B, a custom route table, isn't associated with either subnet.To replace the main route table, start by creating an explicit association between subnet B and route table B. Test route table B.
