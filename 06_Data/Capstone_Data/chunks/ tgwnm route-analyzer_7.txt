Run the route analysis. In the results, verify the path between the source and destination. For example, the following results indicate that there is a forward path from transit gateway 1 to transit gateway 2, but no return path. Check the route table for transit gateway 2, and ensure that there is a static route that points to the peering attachment.To run the analysis between VPC B and the VPN connection, modify the information under Source. Choose the transit gateway attachment for VPC B, and specify an IP address from the CIDR block of VPC B, for example, 10.2.0.9.Reload the results and verify the path between the source and destination.For more information about the routing configuration for this scenario, see the transit gateway peering example.Example: Route analysis with a middlebox configuration
