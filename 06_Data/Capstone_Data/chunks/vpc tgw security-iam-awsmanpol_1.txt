You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for existing services.For more information, see AWS managed policies in the IAM User Guide.To work with a transit gateway, one of the following AWS managed policies might meet your needs:AmazonEC2FullAccessAmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccessPowerUserAccessReadOnlyAccessAWS managed policy: AWSVPCTransitGatewayServiceRolePolicyThis policy is attached to the role AWSServiceRoleForVPCTransitGateway.
