For example, you create a VPC and specify that you want to associate an Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block with the VPC. Amazon assigns the following IPv6 CIDR block to your VPC: 2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56. You cannot choose the range of IP addresses yourself. You can create a subnet and associate an IPv6 CIDR block from this range; for example, 2001:db8:1234:1a00::/64.You can disassociate an IPv6 CIDR block from a VPC. After you've disassociated an IPv6 CIDR block from a VPC, you cannot expect to receive the same CIDR if you associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC again later.Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
