Consider using additional security groups or network interfaces to control and audit Amazon EC2 instance management traffic separately from regular application traffic. Therefore, you can implement special IAM policies for change control, making it easier to audit changes to security group rules or automated rule-verification scripts. Multiple network interfaces also provide additional options for controlling network traffic, including the ability to create host-based routing policies or leverage different VPC subnet routing rules based on an network interfaces assigned to a subnet.Use AWS Virtual Private Network or AWS Direct Connect to establish private connections from your remote networks to your VPCs.
