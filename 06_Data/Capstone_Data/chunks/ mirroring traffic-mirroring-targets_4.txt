The following diagram shows a traffic mirror session where the traffic mirror target is a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint. The mirror source is in the service consumer VPC and the Gateway Load Balancer is in the service provider VPC. You install the monitoring software on the target appliances, and then register them with the load balancer. Traffic Mirroring filters the traffic from the network interface of the mirror source and sends the accepted mirrored traffic to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint. The load balancer sends the mirrored traffic to the target appliances.ConsiderationsA listener for Gateway Load Balancers listens for all IP packets across all ports, and then forwards traffic to the target group.
