To represent your on-premises network, you add devices, links, and sites to your global network. A site represents the physical location of your branch, office, store, campus, or data center. When you add a site, you can specify the location information, including the physical address and coordinates.A device represents the physical or virtual appliance that establishes connectivity with a transit gateway over an IPsec tunnel. A link represents a single outbound internet connection used by a device, for example, a 20-Mbps broadband link.When you create a device, you can specify its physical location, and the site where it's located. A device can have a more specific location than the site, for example, a building in a campus or a floor in a building. When you create a link, you create it for a specific site. You can then associate a device with a link.
