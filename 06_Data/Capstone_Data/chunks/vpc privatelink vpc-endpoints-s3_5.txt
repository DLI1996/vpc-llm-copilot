Your account has a default quota of 20 gateway endpoints per Region, which is adjustable. There is also a limit of 255 gateway endpoints per VPC.Private DNSYou can configure private DNS to optimize costs when you create both a gateway endpoint and an interface endpoint for Amazon S3.Route 53 ResolverAmazon provides a DNS server, called the Route 53 Resolver, for your VPC. The Route 53 Resolver automatically resolves local VPC domain names and records in private hosted zones. However, you can't use the Route 53 Resolver from outside your VPC. Route 53 provides Resolver endpoints and Resolver rules so that you can use the Route 53 Resolver from outside your VPC. An inbound Resolver endpoint forwards DNS queries from the on-premises network to Route 53 Resolver. An outbound Resolver endpoint forwards DNS queries from the Route 53 Resolver to the on-premises network.
