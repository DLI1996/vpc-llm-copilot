With IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and resources as well as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. Infrastructure Performance supports specific actions and resources. There are no Infrastructure Performance service-specific condition keys that can be used in the Condition element of policy statements. To learn about all of the elements that you use in a JSON policy, see IAM JSON policy elements reference in the IAM User Guide.ActionsAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.
