You do not need additional transit gateways for high availability, because transit gateways are highly available by design.Limit the number of transit gateway route tables unless your design requires multiple transit gateway route tables.For redundancy, use a single transit gateway in each Region for disaster recovery.For deployments with multiple transit gateways, we recommend that you use a unique Autonomous System Number (ASN) for each of your transit gateways. You can also use inter-Region peering.
