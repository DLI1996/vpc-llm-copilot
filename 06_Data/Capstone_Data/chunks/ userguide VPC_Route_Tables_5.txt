Each route in a table specifies a destination and a target. For example, to enable your subnet to access the internet through an internet gateway, add the following route to your subnet route table. The destination for the route is 0.0.0.0/0, which represents all IPv4 addresses. The target is the internet gateway that's attached to your VPC.0.0.0.0/0 igw-idCIDR blocks for IPv4 and IPv6 are treated separately. For example, a route with a destination CIDR of 0.0.0.0/0 does not automatically include all IPv6 addresses. You must create a route with a destination CIDR of ::/0 for all IPv6 addresses.
