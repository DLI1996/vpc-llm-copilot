AWSDocumentationAmazon VPCAWS Transit GatewayOverviewResourcesRoutingExample: Peered transit gatewaysYou can create a transit gateway peering connection between transit gateways. You can then route traffic between the attachments for each of the transit gateways. In this scenario, VPC and VPN attachments are associated with the transit gateway default route tables, and they propagate to the transit gateway default route tables. Each transit gateway route table has a static route that points to the transit gateway peering attachment.ContentsOverviewResourcesRoutingOverview
