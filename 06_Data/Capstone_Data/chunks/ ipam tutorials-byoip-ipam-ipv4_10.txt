Step 4: Provision a CIDR to the top-level poolProvision a CIDR block to the top-level pool. Note that when provisioning an IPv4 CIDR to a pool within the top-level pool, the minimum IPv4 CIDR you can provision is /24; more specific CIDRs (such as /25) are not permitted. You must include the CIDR and the BYOIP message and certificate signature in the request so we can verify that you own the public space. For a list of BYOIP prerequisites including how to get this BYOIP message and certificate signature, see Bring your own public IPv4 CIDR to IPAM using only the AWS CLI.This step must be done by the IPAM account.Important
