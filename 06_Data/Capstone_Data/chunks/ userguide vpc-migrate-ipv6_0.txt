Your VPC can operate in dual-stack mode â€” your resources can communicate over IPv4, or IPv6, or both. IPv4 and IPv6 communication are independent of each other.You cannot disable IPv4 support for your VPC and subnets; this is the default IP addressing system for Amazon VPC and Amazon EC2.Considerations
