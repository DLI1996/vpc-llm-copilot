We recommend that you delete the transit gateway peering attachment before you opt out of the Region. If you do not delete the peering attachment, traffic might continue to go over the attachment and you continue to incur charges. If you do not delete the attachment, you can opt back in, and then delete the attachment.In general, the transit gateway has a sender pays model. By using a transit gateway peering attachment across an opt in boundary, you might incur charges in a Region accepting the attachment, including those Regions you have not opted into.
