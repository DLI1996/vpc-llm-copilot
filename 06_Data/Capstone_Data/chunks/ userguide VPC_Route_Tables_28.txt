If your route table contains a propagated route that matches a route that references a prefix list, the route that references the prefix list takes priority. Please note that for routes that overlap, more specific routes always take priority irrespective of whether they are propagated routes, static routes, or routes that reference prefix lists.If your route table references multiple prefix lists that have overlapping CIDR blocks to different targets, we randomly choose which route takes priority. Thereafter, the same route always takes priority.Route table quotasThere is a quota on the number of route tables that you can create per VPC.
