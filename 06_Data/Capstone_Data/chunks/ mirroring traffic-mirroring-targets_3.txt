We recommend that you enable cross-zone load balancing for your Network Load Balancer. If all registered target instances in an Availability Zone become unhealthy and cross-zone load balancing is disabled, the load balancer can't send the mirrored traffic to target instances in another Availability Zone. If you enable cross-zone load balancing, the load balancer can send the mirrored traffic to healthy target instances in another Availability Zone.If you select an additional Availability Zone for your Network Load Balancer after you create it, Traffic Mirroring does not send mirrored traffic to target instances in the new Availability Zone unless you enable cross-zone load balancing.When the Network Load Balancer removes a load balancer node from the DNS table, Traffic Mirroring continues to send the mirrored traffic to that node.Gateway Load Balancer endpoints
