In this configuration, there is a central VPC (VPC A) with one subnet, a peering connection between VPC A and VPC B (pcx-aaaabbbb), and a peering connection between VPC A and VPC C (pcx-aaaacccc). VPC A has a subnet with one instance for each peering connection. You can use this configuration to limit peering traffic to specific instances.Each VPC route table points to the relevant VPC peering connection to access a single IP address (and therefore a specific instance) in the peer VPC.
