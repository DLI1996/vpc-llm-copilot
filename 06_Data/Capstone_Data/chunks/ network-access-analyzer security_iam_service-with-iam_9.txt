Supports policy resources YesAdministrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which principal can perform actions on what resources, and under what conditions.The Resource JSON policy element specifies the object or objects to which the action applies. Statements must include either a Resource or a NotResource element. As a best practice, specify a resource using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You can do this for actions that support a specific resource type, known as resource-level permissions.For actions that don't support resource-level permissions, such as listing operations, use a wildcard (*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.The following Network Access Analyzer API actions do not support resource-level permissions:DescribeNetworkInsightsAccessScopeAnalyses
