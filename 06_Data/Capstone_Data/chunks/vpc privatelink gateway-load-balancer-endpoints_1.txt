You can choose only one Availability Zone in the service consumer VPC. You can't change this subnet later on. To use a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint in a different subnet, you must create a new Gateway Load Balancer endpoint.You can create a single Gateway Load Balancer endpoint per Availability Zone per service, and you must select the Availability Zone that the Gateway Load Balancer supports. When the service provider and service consumer are in different accounts, an Availability Zone name, such as us-east-1a, might be mapped to a different physical Availability Zone in each AWS account. You can use AZ IDs to consistently identify the Availability Zones for your service. For more information, see AZ IDs in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
