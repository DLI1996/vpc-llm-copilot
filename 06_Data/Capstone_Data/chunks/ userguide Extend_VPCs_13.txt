When you launch an EC2 instance in a subnet in a Wavelength Zone, you assign a carrier IP address to it. The carrier gateway uses the address for traffic from the interface to the internet, or mobile devices. The carrier gateway uses NAT to translate the address, and then sends the traffic to the destination. Traffic from the telecommunication carrier network routes through the carrier gateway.You can set the target of a VPC route table, or subnet route table in a Wavelength Zone to a carrier gateway, which allows inbound traffic from a carrier network in a specific location, and outbound traffic to the carrier network and internet. For more information about routing options in a Wavelength Zone, see Routing in the AWS Wavelength Developer Guide.Subnets in Wavelength Zones have the same networking components as subnets in Availability Zones, including IPv4 addresses, DHCP option sets, and network ACLs.
