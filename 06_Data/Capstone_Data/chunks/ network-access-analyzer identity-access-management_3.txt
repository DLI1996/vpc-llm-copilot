Depending on the type of user you are, you can sign in to the AWS Management Console or the AWS accessportal. For more information about signing in to AWS, see How to sign in to your AWS accountin the AWS Sign-In User Guide.If you access AWS programmatically, AWS provides a software development kit (SDK) and a command line interface (CLI) to cryptographically sign your requests by using your credentials. If you don't use AWS tools, you must sign requests yourself. For more information about using the recommended method to sign requests yourself, see Signing AWS API requests in the IAM User Guide.
