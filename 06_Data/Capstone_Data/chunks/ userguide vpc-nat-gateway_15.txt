If you chose Custom in Step 8, skip this step. If you chose Auto-assign, under Number of auto-assigned private IP addresses, choose the number of secondary IPv4 addresses that you want AWS assign to this private NAT gateway. You can choose up to 7 IPv4 addresses. NoteSecondary IPv4 addresses are optional and should be assigned or allocated when your workloads that use a NAT Gateway exceed 55,000 concurrent connections to a single destination (the same destination IP, destination port, and protocol). Secondary IPv4 addresses increase the number of available ports, and therefore they increase the limit on the number of concurrent connections that your workloads can establish using a NAT Gateway.
