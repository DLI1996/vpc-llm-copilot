With this information, you can identify traffic from AWS. You can also use this information to allow or deny traffic to or from some AWS services.NoteOnly some AWS service IP address ranges are published in ip-ranges.json; we publish the IP address ranges for services that customers commonly want to perform egress filtering on.Services may use the IP address ranges to communicate with other services (for example Route 53 health checks may use an EC2 IP address range to check the health of a web server instance) or services may use the IP ranges to communicate with a customer network.
