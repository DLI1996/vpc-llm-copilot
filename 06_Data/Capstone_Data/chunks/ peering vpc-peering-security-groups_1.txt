If you configure routes to forward the traffic between two instances in different subnets through a middlebox appliance, you must ensure that the security groups for both instances allow traffic to flow between the instances. The security group for each instance must reference the private IP address of the other instance, or the CIDR range of the subnet that contains the other instance, as the source. If you reference the security group of the other instance as the source, this does not allow traffic to flow between the instances.To update your security group rules using the consoleOpen the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.In the navigation pane, choose Security groups.Select the security group, and choose Actions, Edit inbound rules to modify the inbound rules or choose Actions, Edit outbound rules to modify the outbound rules.
