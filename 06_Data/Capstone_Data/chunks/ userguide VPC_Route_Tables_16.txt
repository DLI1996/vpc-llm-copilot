Route table A is a custom route table that is explicitly associated with the public subnet. It has a route that sends all traffic to the internet gateway, which is what makes the subnet a public subnet.VPC CIDR Local 0.0.0.0/0 igw-idRoute table B is the main route table. It is implicitly associated with the private subnet. It has a route that sends all traffic to the virtual private gateway, but no route to the internet gateway, which is what makes the subnet a VPN-only subnet. If you create another subnet in this VPC and don't associate a custom route table, the subnet will also be implicitly associated with this route table because it is the main route table.
