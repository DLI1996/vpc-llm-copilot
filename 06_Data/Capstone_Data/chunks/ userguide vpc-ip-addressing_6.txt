You can assign additional private IP addresses, known as secondary private IP addresses, to instances that are running in a VPC. Unlike a primary private IP address, you can reassign a secondary private IP address from one network interface to another. A private IP address remains associated with the network interface when the instance is stopped and restarted, and is released when the instance is terminated. For more information about primary and secondary IP addresses, see Multiple IP Addresses in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
