An IPv6 address persists when you stop and start, or hibernate and start, your instance, and is released when you terminate your instance. You cannot reassign an IPv6 address while it's assigned to another network interfaceâ€”you must first unassign it.You can control whether instances are reachable via their IPv6 addresses by controlling the routing for your subnet or by using security group and network ACL rules.
