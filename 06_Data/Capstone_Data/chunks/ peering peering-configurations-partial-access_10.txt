In this configuration, there is a central VPC (VPC A) with one subnet, a peering connection between VPC A and VPC B (pcx-aaaabbbb), and a peering connection between VPC A and VPC C (pcx-aaaacccc). VPC B and VPC C each have two subnets. The peering connection between VPC A and VPC B uses only one of the subnets in VPC B. The peering connection between VPC A and VPC C uses only one of the subnets in VPC C.Use this configuration when you have a central VPC that has a single set of resources, such as Active Directory services, that other VPCs need to access. The central VPC does not require full access to the VPCs that it's peered with.
