10.0.0.0/8 CIDR blocks from other RFC 1918* ranges (172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16). If any of the CIDR blocks associated with the VPC are from the 10.0.0.0/15 range (10.0.0.0 to 10.1.255.255), you cannot add a CIDR block from the 10.0.0.0/16 range (10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255). CIDR blocks from the 198.19.0.0/16 range. Any other CIDR block from the 10.0.0.0/8 range that's not restricted. Any publicly routable IPv4 CIDR block (non-RFC 1918), or a CIDR block from the 100.64.0.0/10 range. 169.254.0.0/16 CIDR blocks from the "link local" block are reserved as described in RFC 5735 and cannot be assigned to VPCs.
