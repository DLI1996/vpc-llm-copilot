A route table can have both an endpoint route to Amazon S3 and an endpoint route to DynamoDB. You can have endpoint routes to the same service (Amazon S3 or DynamoDB) in multiple route tables. You can't have multiple endpoint routes to the same service (Amazon S3 or DynamoDB) in a single route table.
