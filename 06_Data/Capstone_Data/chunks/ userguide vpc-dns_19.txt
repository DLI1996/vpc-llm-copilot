To access resources using custom DNS domain names, you must be connected to an instance within your VPC. From your instance, you can test that your resource in your private hosted zone is accessible from its custom DNS name by using the ping command; for example, ping mywebserver.example.com. (You must ensure that your instance's security group rules allow inbound ICMP traffic for the ping command to work.)Private hosted zones do not support transitive relationships outside of the VPC; for example, you cannot access your resources using their custom private DNS names from the other side of a VPN connection.ImportantIf you use custom DNS domain names defined in a private hosted zone in Amazon Route 53, you must set both the enableDnsHostnames and enableDnsSupport attributes to true.Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.
