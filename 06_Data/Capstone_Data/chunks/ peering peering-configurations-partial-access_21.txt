Similarly, VPC D and VPC Z have overlapping CIDR blocks. Peering traffic between VPC D and VPC X is limited to subnet 2 in VPC D, and peering traffic between VPC X and VPC Z is limited to subnet 1 in VPC Z. This is to ensure that if VPC X receives peering traffic from VPC D or VPC Z, it sends the response traffic back to the correct VPC.The route tables for VPCs B, C, E, F, and G point to the relevant peering connections to access the full CIDR block for VPC A, and the VPC A route table points to the relevant peering connections for VPCs B, C, E, F, and G to access their full CIDR blocks. For peering connection pcx-aaaadddd, the VPC A route table routes traffic only to subnet 1 in VPC D and the subnet 1 route table in VPC D points to the full CIDR block of VPC A.
