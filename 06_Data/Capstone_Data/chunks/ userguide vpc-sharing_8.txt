Participants can create a limited set of VPC resources in a shared VPC. For example, participants can create network interfaces and security groups, and enable VPC flow logs for the network interfaces that they own. The VPC resources that a participant creates count against the VPC quotas in the participant account, not the owner account. For more information, see VPC sharing.Billing and metering for the owner and participants
