Traffic bandwidth and prioritizationMirrored traffic counts toward instance bandwidth. For example, if you mirror a network interface that has 1 Gbps of inbound traffic and 1 Gbps of outbound traffic, the instance must handle 4 Gbps of traffic (1 Gbps inbound, 1 Gbps mirrored inbound, 1 Gbps outbound, and 1 Gbps mirrored outbound).Production traffic has a higher priority than mirrored traffic when there is traffic congestion. As a result, mirrored traffic is dropped when there is congestion.By default, each Gateway Load Balancer endpoint can support a bandwidth of up to 10 Gbps per Availability Zone and automatically scales up to 100 Gbps.
