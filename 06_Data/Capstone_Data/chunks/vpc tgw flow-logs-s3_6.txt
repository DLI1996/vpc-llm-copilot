Amazon S3 bucket permissions for flow logsBy default, Amazon S3 buckets and the objects they contain are private. Only the bucket owner can access the bucket and the objects stored in it. However, the bucket owner can grant access to other resources and users by writing an access policy.If the user creating the flow log owns the bucket and has PutBucketPolicy and GetBucketPolicy permissions for the bucket, we automatically attach the following policy to the bucket. This policy overwrites any existing policy attached to the bucket.Otherwise, the bucket owner must add this policy to the bucket, specifying the AWS account ID of the flow log creator, or flow log creation fails. For more information, see Using bucket policies in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [
