asn-ranges â€” The Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) to assign to Core Network Edges. By default, the core network automatically assigns an ASN for each Core Network Edge, but you can optionally define the ASN in the edge-locations for each Region. The ASN uses an array of integer ranges only from 64512 to 65534 and 4200000000 to 4294967294. No other ASN ranges can be used. For example, you might have the following: "asn-ranges": [ "64512-65534", "4200000000-4294967294" ],
