A transit gateway doesn't support routing between VPCs with identical CIDRs. If you attach a VPC to a transit gateway and its CIDR is identical to the CIDR of another VPC that's already attached to the transit gateway, the routes for the newly attached VPC aren't propagated to the transit gateway route table.You can't create an attachment for a VPC subnet that resides in a Local Zone. However, you can configure your network so that subnets in the Local Zone can connect to a transit gateway through the parent Availability Zone. For more information, see Connect Local Zone subnets to a transit gateway.You can't create a transit gateway attachment using IPv6-only subnets. Transit gateway attachment subnets must also support IPv4 addresses.
