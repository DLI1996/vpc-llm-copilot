The following diagram shows a VPC endpoint for Amazon CloudWatch with endpoint network interfaces in two Availability Zones. When any resource in any subnet in the VPC accesses Amazon CloudWatch by using its public endpoint, we select a healthy endpoint network interface, using the round robin algorithm to alternate between them. We then resolve the traffic to the IP address of the selected endpoint network interface.If it's better for your use case, you can send traffic from your resources to the AWS service by using the endpoint network interface in the same Availability Zone. To do so, use the private zonal endpoint or IP address of the endpoint network interface.IP address typesAWS services can support IPv6 through their private endpoints even if they do not support IPv6 through their public endpoints. Endpoints that support IPv6 can respond to DNS queries with AAAA records.
