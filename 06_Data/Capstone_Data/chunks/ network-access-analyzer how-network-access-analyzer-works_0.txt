It then produces findings for paths that match a customer defined Network Access Scope. Network Access Analyzer performs a static analysis of a network configuration, meaning that no packets are transmitted in the network as part of this analysis. Because Network Access Analyzer only considers the state of the network as described in the network configuration, packet loss that is due to to transient network interruptions or service failures is not considered in the analysis.
