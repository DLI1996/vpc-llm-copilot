If you create a VPC using a command line tool or the Amazon EC2 API, the CIDR block is automatically modified to its canonical form. For example, if you specify 100.68.0.18/18 for the CIDR block, we create a CIDR block of 100.68.0.0/18.Manage IPv4 CIDR blocks for a VPCYou can associate secondary IPv4 CIDR blocks with your VPC. When you associate a CIDR block with your VPC, a route is automatically added to your VPC route tables to enable routing within the VPC (the destination is the CIDR block and the target is local).In the following example, the VPC has both a primary and a secondary CIDR block. The CIDR blocks for Subnet A and Subnet B are from the primary VPC CIDR block. The CIDR block for Subnet C is from the secondary VPC CIDR block.The following route table shows the local routes for the VPC.10.0.0.0/16 Local 10.2.0.0/16 Local
