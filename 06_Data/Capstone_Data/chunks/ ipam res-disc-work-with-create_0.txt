The default quota for resource discoveries per Region is 1. For more information about IPAM quotas, see Quotas for your IPAM.NoteCreating, sharing, and associating resource discoveries is part of the process of integrating IPAM with accounts outside of your organizations (see Integrate IPAM with accounts outside of your organization). If you are not creating an IPAM and integrating it with accounts outside your organization, you do not need to create, share, or associate resource discoveries.
