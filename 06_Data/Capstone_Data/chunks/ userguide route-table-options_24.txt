Routing using a prefix listIf you frequently reference the same set of CIDR blocks across your AWS resources, you can create a customer-managed prefix list to group them together. You can then specify the prefix list as the destination in your route table entry. You can later add or remove entries for the prefix list without needing to update your route tables.For example, you have a transit gateway with multiple VPC attachments. The VPCs must be able to communicate with two specific VPC attachments that have the following CIDR blocks:10.0.0.0/1610.2.0.0/16You create a prefix list with both entries. In your subnet route tables, you create a route and specify the prefix list as the destination, and the transit gateway as the target.
