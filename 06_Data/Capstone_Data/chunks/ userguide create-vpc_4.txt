A range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, into your subnets. Each subnet resides entirely within one Availability Zone. By launching instances in at least two Availability Zones, you can protect your applications from the failure of a single Availability Zone. A public subnet has a direct route to an internet gateway. Resources in a public subnet can access the public internet. A private subnet does not have a direct route to an internet gateway. Resources in a private subnet require another component, such as a NAT device, to access the public internet. For more information, see Subnets.Tenancy
