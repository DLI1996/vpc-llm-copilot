When you create a transit gateway, we create a default transit gateway route table and use it as the default association route table and the default propagation route table. You can use CreateTransitGatewayRouteTable to create additional transit gateway route tables. If you disable automatic route propagation, we do not create a default transit gateway route table. You can use EnableTransitGatewayRouteTablePropagation to propagate routes from a resource attachment to a transit gateway route table. If you disable automatic associations, you can use AssociateTransitGatewayRouteTable to associate a resource attachment with a transit gateway route table.Request ParametersThe following parameters are for this specific action.
