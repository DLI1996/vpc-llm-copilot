You have the same allocation rule options here as you did when you created the top-level pool. See Create a top-level IPv4 pool for an explanation of the options that are available when you create pools. The allocation rules for the Regional pool are not inherited from the top-level pool. If you do not apply any rules here, there will be no allocation rules set for the pool. (Optional) Choose Tags for the pool. When you’ve finished configuring your pool, choose Create pool.See Create a development IPv4 pool.
