ResourcesInfrastructure Performance does not support resource-level permissions.For actions that don't support resource-level permissions, such as listing operations, use a wildcard (*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.Condition keysThe Condition element (or Condition block) lets you specify conditions in which a statement is in effect. For example, you might want a policy to be applied only after a specific date. To express conditions, use predefined condition keys.Infrastructure Performance does not provide any service-specific condition keys, but it does support using some global condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see AWS global condition context keys in the IAM User Guide.All Amazon EC2 actions support the aws:RequestedRegion and ec2:Region condition keys. For more information, see Example: Restricting Access to a Specific Region.
