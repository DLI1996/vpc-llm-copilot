If you have Local Zones or Wavelength Zones enabled (for more information, see Enable a Local Zone or Enable Wavelength Zones), you can choose a network border group for AZs, Local Zones, or Wavelength Zones. Choose the network border group carefully as the EIP and the AWS resource it is associated with must reside in the same network border group. You can use the EC2 console to view the network border group that your Availability Zones, Local Zones, or Wavelength Zones are in (see Local Zones). Typically, all Availability Zones in a Region belong to the same network border group, whereas Local Zones or Wavelength Zones belong to their own separate network border groups.
