A Connect attachment uses an existing VPC or Direct Connect attachment as the underlying transport mechanism. This is referred to as the transport attachment. The transit gateway identifies matched GRE packets from the third-party appliance as traffic from the Connect attachment. It treats any other packets, including GRE packets with incorrect source or destination information, as traffic from the transport attachment.NoteTo use a Direct Connect attachment as a transport mechanism, you'll first need to integrate Direct Connect with AWS Transit Gateway. For the steps to create this integration, see Integrate SD-WAN devices with AWS Transit Gateway and AWS Direct Connect.ContentsConnect peersRequirements and considerationsCreate a Connect attachmentCreate a Connect peer (GRE tunnel)View your Connect attachments and Connect peersModify your Connect attachment and Connect peer tags
