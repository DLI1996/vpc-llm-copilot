You should verify this assumption.ASSUMPTION_PRESERVE_CLIENT_IP_IS_ENABLEDThe analysis could not describe target group attributes for the target group, so the network path is based on the assumption that client IP preservation is enabled on the target group. You should verify this assumption.AVAILABILITY_ZONE_CROSSEDThe network path crosses Availability Zones.
