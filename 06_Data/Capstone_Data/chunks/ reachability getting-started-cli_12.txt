The following is example output where the path is reachable. When a path is reachable, NetworkPathFound is true, ForwardPathComponents contains component-by-component details about the shortest reachable path from source to destination, and ReturnPathComponents contains component-by-component details about the shortest reachable path from destination to source.{ "NetworkInsightsAnalyses": [{ "NetworkInsightsAnalysisId": "nia-076744f74a04c3c7f", "NetworkInsightsAnalysisArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:network-insights-analysisbia-076744f74a04c3c7f", "NetworkInsightsPathId": "nip-0614b9507b4e3e989", "StartDate": "2023-03-20T23:47:08.080Z", "Status": "succeeded", "NetworkPathFound": true, "ForwardPathComponents": [{ "SequenceNumber": 1, "Component":
