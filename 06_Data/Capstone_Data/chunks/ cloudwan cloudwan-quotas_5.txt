BandwidthYour AWS account has the following bandwidth quotas for AWS Cloud WAN.You can use equal-cost multipath routing (ECMP) to get higher VPN bandwidth by aggregating multiple VPN tunnels. To use ECMP, the VPN connection must be configured for dynamic routing. ECMP is not supported on VPN connections that use static routing.You can create up to four Connect peers per Connect attachment (up to 20 Gbps in total bandwidth per Connect attachment). You can use ECMP to get higher bandwidth by scaling horizontally across multiple Connect peers of the same Connect attachment or across multiple Connect attachments. Core network cannot use ECMP between the BGP peerings of the same Connect peer.
