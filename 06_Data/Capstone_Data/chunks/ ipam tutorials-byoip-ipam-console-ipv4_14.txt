Choose Use this pool to allocate CIDRs to resources such as VPCs. You have the same allocation rule options here as you did when you created the top-level pool. See Create a top-level IPv4 pool for an explanation of the options that are available when you create pools. The allocation rules for the Regional pool are not inherited from the top-level pool. If you do not apply any rules here, there will be no allocation rules set for the pool.
