When dynamic routing is used with a VPN attachment or a Direct Connect gateway attachment, you can propagate the routes learned from the on-premises router through BGP to any of the transit gateway route tables.When dynamic routing is used with a VPN attachment, the routes in the route table associated with the VPN attachment are advertised to the customer gateway through BGP.For a Connect attachment, routes in the route table associated with the Connect attachment are advertised to the third-party virtual appliances, such as SD-WAN appliances, running in a VPC through BGP.For a Direct Connect gateway attachment, allowed prefixes interactions control which routes are advertised to the customer network from AWS.
