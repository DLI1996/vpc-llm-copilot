To demonstrate a simple example of using a transit gateway, create two VPCs in the same Region. The VPCs cannot have overlapping CIDRs. Launch one Amazon EC2 instance in each VPC. For more information, see Get started with Amazon VPC in the Amazon VPC User Guide.You cannot have identical routes pointing to two different VPCs. A transit gateway does not propagate the CIDRs of a newly attached VPC if an identical route exists in the transit gateway route tables.Verify that you have the permissions required to work with transit gateways. For more information, see Identity and access management for your transit gateways.You can't ping between hosts if you haven't added an ICMP rule to each of the host security groups. For more information, see Work with security groups in the Amazon VPC User Guide.Step 1: Create the transit gateway
