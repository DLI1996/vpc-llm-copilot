If you enable route propagation for the destination subnet route table, be aware of route priority. We prioritize the most specific route, and if the routes match, we prioritize static routes over propagated routes. Review your routes to ensure that traffic is routed correctly and that there are no unintended consequences if you enable or disable route propagation (for example, route propagation is required for an AWS Direct Connect connection that supports jumbo frames).To route inbound VPC traffic to an appliance, you associate a route table with the internet gateway or virtual private gateway, and specify the network interface of your appliance as the target for VPC traffic. For more information, see Gateway route tables. You can also route outbound traffic from your subnet to a middlebox appliance in another subnet.
