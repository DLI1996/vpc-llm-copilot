The following are example rules for a security group for your web servers. The web servers can receive HTTP and HTTPS traffic from all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and send SQL or MySQL traffic to your database servers.WarningWhen you add rules for ports 22 (SSH) or 3389 (RDP) so that you can access your EC2 instances, we recommend that you authorize only specific IP address ranges. If you specify 0.0.0.0/0 (IPv4) and ::/ (IPv6), this enables anyone to access your instances from any IP address using the specified protocol.
