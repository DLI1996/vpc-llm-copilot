Transit Gateway Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from your transit gateways. Flow log data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, or Kinesis Data Firehose. After you create a flow log, you can retrieve and view its data in the chosen destination. Flow log data is collected outside of the path of your network traffic, and therefore does not affect network throughput or latency. You can create or delete flow logs without any risk of impact to network performance. Transit Gateway Flow Logs capture information related only to transit gateways, described in Transit Gateway Flow Log records. If you want to capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPCs, use VPC Flow Logs. See Logging IP traffic using VPC Flow Logs in the Amazon VPC User Guide for more information.Note
