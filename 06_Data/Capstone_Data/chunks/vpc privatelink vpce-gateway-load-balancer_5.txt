To route traffic to the endpoint service, specify the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint as a target in your route tables, using its ID. For the diagram above, add routes to the route tables as follows. Note that IPv6 routes are included for a dualstack configuration.Route table for the internet gatewayThis route table must have a route that sends traffic destined for the application servers to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint.VPC IPv4 CIDR Local VPC IPv6 CIDR Local Application subnet IPv4 CIDR vpc-endpoint-id Application subnet IPv6 CIDR vpc-endpoint-idRoute table for the subnet with the application serversThis route table must have a route that sends all traffic from the application servers to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint.
