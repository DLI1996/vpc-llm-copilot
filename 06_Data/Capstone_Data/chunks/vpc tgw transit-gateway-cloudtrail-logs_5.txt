A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events as log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. CloudTrail log files contain one or more log entries. An event represents a single request from any source and includes information about the requested action, the date and time of the action, request parameters, and so on. CloudTrail log files aren't an ordered stack trace of the public API calls, so they don't appear in any specific order.The log files include events for all API calls for your AWS account, not just transit gateway API calls. You can locate calls to the transit gateway API by checking for eventSource elements with the value ec2.amazonaws.com. To view a record for a specific action, such as CreateTransitGateway, check for eventName elements with the action name.
