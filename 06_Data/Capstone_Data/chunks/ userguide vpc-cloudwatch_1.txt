Network Address Usage (NAU) is a metric applied to resources in your virtual network to help you plan for and monitor the size of your VPC. There is no cost to monitor NAU. Monitoring NAU is helpful because if you exhaust the NAU or peered NAU quotas for your VPC, you can't launch new EC2 instances or provision new resources, such as Network Load Balancers, VPC endpoints, Lambda functions, transit gateway attachments, and NAT gateways.If you've enabled Network Address Usage monitoring for a VPC, Amazon VPC sends metrics related to NAU to Amazon CloudWatch. The size of a VPC is measured by the number of Network Address Usage (NAU) units that the VPC contains.You can use these metrics to understand the rate of your VPC growth, forecast when your VPC will reach its size limit, or create alarms when size thresholds are crossed.
