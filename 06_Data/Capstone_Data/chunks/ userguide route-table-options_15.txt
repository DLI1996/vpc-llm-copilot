Direct traffic between two subnets to a middlebox appliance. You can do so by creating a route for one subnet route table that matches the subnet CIDR of the other subnet and specifies a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, NAT gateway, Network Firewall endpoint, or the network interface for an appliance as a target. Alternatively, to redirect all traffic from the subnet to any other subnet, replace the target of the local route with a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, NAT gateway, or network interface.You can configure the appliance to suit your needs. For example, you can configure a security appliance that screens all traffic, or a WAN acceleration appliance. The appliance is deployed as an Amazon EC2 instance in a subnet in your VPC, and is represented by an elastic network interface (network interface) in your subnet.
