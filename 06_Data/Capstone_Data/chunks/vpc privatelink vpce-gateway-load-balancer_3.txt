If a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint supports IPv4, the endpoint network interfaces have IPv4 addresses. If a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint supports IPv6, the endpoint network interfaces have IPv6 addresses. The IPv6 address for an endpoint network interface is unreachable from the internet. If you describe an endpoint network interface with an IPv6 address, notice that denyAllIgwTraffic is enabled.Requirements to enable IPv6 for an endpoint serviceThe VPC and subnets for the endpoint service must have associated IPv6 CIDR blocks.The Gateway Load Balancer for the endpoint service must use the dualstack IP address type. The security appliances do not need to support IPv6 traffic.Requirements to enable IPv6 for a Gateway Load Balancer endpointThe endpoint service must have an IP address type that includes IPv6 support.
