The following diagram shows a VPC with subnets in two Availability Zones, an internet gateway, and an Application Load Balancer. Each Availability Zone has a public subnet for web servers and a private subnet for database servers. There are separate security groups for the load balancer, the web servers, and the database servers. You can add rules to the security group for the load balancer to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic from the internet. You can add rules to the security group for the web servers to allow traffic only from the load balancer. You can add rules to the security group for the database servers to allow only database requests from the web servers.For information about the differences between security groups and network ACLs, see Compare security groups and network ACLs.ContentsSecurity groupsSecurity group rulesDefault security groups for your VPCsJavascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.
