Note that if the instances in the private subnet in Availability Zone A also need to reach the internet, you can create a route from this subnet to the NAT gateway in Availability Zone B. Alternatively, you can improve resiliency by creating a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone that contains resources that require internet access. For an example diagram, see Example: VPC with servers in private subnets and NAT.RoutingThe following is the route table associated with the public subnet in Availability Zone A. The first entry is the local route; it enables the instances in the subnet to communicate with other instances in the VPC using private IP addresses. The second entry sends all other subnet traffic to the internet gateway, which enables the instances in the subnet to access the internet.
