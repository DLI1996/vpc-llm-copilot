The following diagram shows a deployment of a GWLB for traffic mirroring utilizing GWLBe interfaces. The GWLB is deployed in a centralized Service VPC with multiple appliances as targets. The GWLB is set up for each Availability Zone that the customer wants to monitor traffic, and it can configure their GWLB with cross-zone load balancing as an option to protect against single Availability Zone failures. In the spoke VPCs, GWLBe interfaces are deployed in each spoke VPC. These endpoints are connected to the GWLB to send traffic from the spoke VPC to the Service VPC.Consider the scenario where you want to mirror inbound TCP traffic on an instance and then send it to a Gateway Load Balancer via a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint. You need the following Traffic Mirroring entities for this example:A Traffic Mirroring target for the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint (Target A) in Spoke VPC1
