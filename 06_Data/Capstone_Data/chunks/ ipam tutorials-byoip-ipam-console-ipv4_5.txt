Under Locale, choose None. The locale is the AWS Region where you want this IPAM pool to be available for allocations. For example, you can only allocate a CIDR for a VPC from an IPAM pool that shares a locale with the VPC’s Region. Note that when you have chosen a locale for a pool, you cannot modify it. If the home Region of the IPAM is unavailable due to an outage and the pool has a locale different than the home Region of the IPAM, the pool can still be used to allocate IP addresses. The IPAM integration with BYOIP requires that the locale is set on whichever pool will be used for the BYOIP CIDR. Since we are going to create a top-level IPAM pool with a Regional pool within it, and we’re going to allocate space to an Elastic IP address from the Regional pool, you will set the locale on the Regional pool and not the top-level
