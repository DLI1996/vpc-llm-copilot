The following diagram shows a traffic mirror session where the traffic mirror target is a Network Load Balancer. You install the monitoring software on the target instances, and then register them with the load balancer. Traffic Mirroring filters the traffic from the network interface of the mirror source and sends the accepted mirrored traffic to the load balancer. The load balancer sends the mirrored traffic to the target instances.ConsiderationsTraffic mirroring can't occur unless the load balancer has UDP listeners on port 4789. If you remove the UDP listeners, Traffic Mirroring fails without an error indication.To improve availability and fault tolerance, we recommend that you select at least two Availability Zones when you create the Network Load Balancer, and that you register target instances in each selected Availability Zone.
