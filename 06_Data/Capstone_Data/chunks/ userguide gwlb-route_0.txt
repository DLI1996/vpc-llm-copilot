The owner of the service consumer VPC creates a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint in a subnet in their VPC (represented by an endpoint network interface). All traffic entering the VPC through the internet gateway is first routed to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint for inspection before it's routed to the application subnet. Similarly, all traffic leaving the application subnet is first routed to Gateway Load Balancer endpoint for inspection before it is routed to the internet.
