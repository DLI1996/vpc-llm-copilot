When published to CloudWatch Logs, the flow log data is published to a log group, and each transit gateway has a unique log stream in the log group. Log streams contain flow log records. You can create multiple flow logs that publish data to the same log group. If the same transit gateway is present in one or more flow logs in the same log group, it has one combined log stream. If you've specified that one flow log should capture rejected traffic, and the other flow log should capture accepted traffic, then the combined log stream captures all traffic.Data ingestion and archival charges for vended logs apply when you publish flow logs to CloudWatch Logs.
