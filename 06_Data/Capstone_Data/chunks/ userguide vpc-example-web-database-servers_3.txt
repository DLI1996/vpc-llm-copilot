For this example configuration, you create a security group for the load balancer, a security group for the web servers, and a security group for the database servers.Load balancerThe security group for your Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer must allow inbound traffic from clients on the load balancer listener port. To accept traffic from anywhere on the internet, specify 0.0.0.0/0 as the source. The load balancer security group must also allow outbound traffic from the load balancer to the target instances on the instance listener port and the health check port.Web serversThe following security group rules allow the web servers to receive HTTP and HTTPS traffic from the load balancer. You can optionally allow the web servers to receive SSH or RDP traffic from your network. The web servers can send SQL or MySQL traffic to your database servers.
