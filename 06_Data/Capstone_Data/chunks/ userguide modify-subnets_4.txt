By default, all subnets have the IPv6 addressing attribute set to false. You can modify this attribute using the Amazon VPC console. If you enable the IPv6 addressing attribute for your subnet, network interfaces created in the subnet receive an IPv6 address from the range of the subnet. Instances launched into the subnet receive an IPv6 address on the primary network interface.Your subnet must have an associated IPv6 CIDR block.NoteIf you enable the IPv6 addressing feature for your subnet, your network interface or instance only receives an IPv6 address if it's created using version 2016-11-15 or later of the Amazon EC2 API. The Amazon EC2 console uses the latest API version.To modify your subnet's IPv6 addressing behaviorOpen the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.In the navigation pane, choose Subnets.Select your subnet and choose Actions, Edit subnet settings.
