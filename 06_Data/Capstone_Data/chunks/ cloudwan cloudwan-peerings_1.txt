The peering connection supports policy-based routing to implement segment isolation across peering connections. Using this capability, routes are selectively propagated between a route table in transit gateway and a core network segment. You first need to create the peering connection and associate a policy table to the transit gateway peering attachment. A policy table contains rules for matching network traffic by a specific route table or segment, and then maps traffic that matches the rule to a target route table for determining routing behavior.
