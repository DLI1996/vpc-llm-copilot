When publishing to CloudWatch Logs, flow log data is published to a log group, and each network interface has a unique log stream in the log group. Log streams contain flow log records. You can create multiple flow logs that publish data to the same log group. If the same network interface is present in one or more flow logs in the same log group, it has one combined log stream. If you've specified that one flow log should capture rejected traffic, and the other flow log should capture accepted traffic, then the combined log stream captures all traffic.In CloudWatch Logs, the timestamp field corresponds to the start time that's captured in the flow log record. The ingestionTime field indicates the date and time when the flow log record was received by CloudWatch Logs. This timestamp is later than the end time that's captured in the flow log record.
