Ensure that the network ACLs that are associated with the private subnet and public subnets do not have rules that block inbound or outbound internet traffic. For the ping command to work, the rules must also allow inbound and outbound ICMP traffic. You can enable flow logs to help you diagnose dropped connections because of network ACL or security group rules. For more information, see Logging IP traffic using VPC Flow Logs.If you are using the ping command, ensure that you are pinging a host that has ICMP enabled. If ICMP is not enabled, you will not receive reply packets. To test this, perform the same ping command from the command line terminal on your own computer.Check that your instance is able to ping other resources, for example, other instances in the private subnet (assuming that security group rules allow this).
