Your domain is associated with a set of domain name service (DNS) records that you manage through your DNS provider. A TXT record is a type of DNS record that provides additional information about your domain. It consists of a name and a value. As part of the verification process, you must add a TXT record to the DNS server for your public domain.Domain ownership verification is complete when we detect the existence of the TXT record in your domain's DNS settings.
