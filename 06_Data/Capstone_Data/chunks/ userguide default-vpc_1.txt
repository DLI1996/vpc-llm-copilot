View your default VPC and default subnetsCreate a default VPCCreate a default subnetDelete your default subnets and default VPCDefault VPC componentsWhen we create a default VPC, we do the following to set it up for you:Create a VPC with a size /16 IPv4 CIDR block (172.31.0.0/16). This provides up to 65,536 private IPv4 addresses.Create a size /20 default subnet in each Availability Zone. This provides up to 4,096 addresses per subnet, a few of which are reserved for our use.Create an internet gateway and connect it to your default VPC.Add a route to the main route table that points all traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the internet gateway.Create a default security group and associate it with your default VPC.Create a default network access control list (ACL) and associate it with your default VPC.Associate the default DHCP options set for your AWS account with your default VPC.Note
