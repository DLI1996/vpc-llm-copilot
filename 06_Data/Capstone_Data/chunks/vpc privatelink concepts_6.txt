When you create a VPC endpoint, the endpoint service receives a connection request. The service provider can accept or reject the request. If the service provider accepts the request, the service consumer can use the VPC endpoint after it enters the Available state.The following are the possible states for a VPC endpoint:PendingAcceptance - The connection request is pending. This is the initial state if requests are manually accepted.Pending - The service provider accepted the connection request. This is the initial state if requests are automatically accepted. The VPC endpoint returns to this state if the service consumer modifies the VPC endpoint.Available - The VPC endpoint is available for use.Rejected - The service provider rejected the connection request. The service provider can also reject a connection after it is available for use.Expired - The connection request expired.
