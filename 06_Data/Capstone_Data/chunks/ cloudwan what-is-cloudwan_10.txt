Segment actions and attachment policies Segment actions define how routing works between segments. After you create a segment, you can choose to map attachments to the segments either by explicitly mapping a resource to a segment (for example, "VpcId: "vpc-2f09a348) or by creating and using attachment policies. Instead of manually associating a segment to each attachment, attachments are tagged. Those tags are then associated with the applicable segment. When attachments are mapped to segments, you can choose how routes are shared between segments. For example, you might want to share access to a VPN across multiple segments, or allow access between two types of branch offices. You can also choose to configure centralized internet routing for a segment, or route traffic between segments through a firewall.
