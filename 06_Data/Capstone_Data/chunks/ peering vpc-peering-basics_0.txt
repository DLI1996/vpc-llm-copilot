The accepter VPC can be owned by you, or another AWS account, and cannot have a CIDR block that overlaps with the CIDR block of the requester VPC.The owner of the accepter VPC accepts the VPC peering connection request to activate the VPC peering connection.To enable the flow of traffic between the VPCs using private IP addresses, the owner of each VPC in the VPC peering connection must manually add a route to one or more of their VPC route tables that points to the IP address range of the other VPC (the peer VPC).
