VPC is 3:05 PM, which is when IPAM discovered it, not 2:00 PM, which is when you created the VPC. Now, let’s say that you decide to delete the VPC at 5:00 PM. When the VPC is deleted, the CIDR 10.0.0.0/16 that was allocated to the VPC is recycled back into the IPAM pool. IPAM takes its periodic snapshot at 5:05 PM and picks up the change. When you search for the ID of this VPC in Search IP history, 5:05 PM is the Sampled end time for the VPC’s CIDR, not 5:00 PM, which is when the VPC was deleted.
