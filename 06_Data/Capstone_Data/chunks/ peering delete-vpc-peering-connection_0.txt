You can also delete a VPC peering connection that you've requested that is still in the pending-acceptance state.You cannot delete the VPC peering connection when the VPC peering connection is in the rejected state. We automatically delete the connection for you.Deleting a VPC in the Amazon VPC console that's part of an active VPC peering connection also deletes the VPC peering connection. If you have requested a VPC peering connection with a VPC in another account, and you delete your VPC before the other party has accepted the request, the VPC peering connection is also deleted. You cannot delete a VPC for which you have a pending-acceptance request from a VPC in another account. You must first reject the VPC peering connection request.
