Step 3. Create a ROA object in your RIR. This may require you to create a key pair as described in Step 1. Create a key pair and certificate. When you create the ROAs, for IPv4 CIDRs you must set the maximum length of an IP address prefix to /24. For IPv6 CIDRs, if you are adding them to an advertisable pool, the maximum length of an IP address prefix must be /48. This ensures that you have full flexibility to divide your public IP address across AWS Regions. IPAM enforces the maximum length you set. The maximum length is the smallest prefix length announcement you will allow for this route. For example, if you bring a /20 CIDR block to AWS, by setting the maximum length to /24, you can divide the larger block any way you like (such as with /21, /22, or /24) and distribute
