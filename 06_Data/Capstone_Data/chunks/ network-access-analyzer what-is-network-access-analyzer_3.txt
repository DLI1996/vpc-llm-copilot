You can specify your network access requirements as Network Access Scopes, which determine the types of findings that the analysis produces. You add entries to MatchPaths to specify the types of network paths to identify. You add entries to ExcludePaths to specify the types of network paths to exclude. MatchPaths â€“ Specifies the types of network paths that an analysis produces. Typically, you specify network paths that you consider to be a violation of your security or compliance requirements. For example, if you don't want to allow network paths that start in VPC A and end in VPC B, specify VPC A as a source and VPC B as a destination. When you analyze this Network Access Scope, you would see any findings that indicate any potential network paths that start in VPC A and end in VPC B.
