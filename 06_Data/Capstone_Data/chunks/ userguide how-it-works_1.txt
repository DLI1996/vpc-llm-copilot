The following is a visual representation of a VPC and its resources from the Preview pane shown when you create a VPC using the AWS Management Console. For an existing VPC, you can access this visualization on the Resource map tab. This example shows the resources that are initially selected on the Create VPC page when you choose to create the VPC plus other networking resources. This VPC is configured with an IPv4 CIDR and an Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR, subnets in two Availability Zones, three route tables, an internet gateway, and a gateway endpoint. Because we've selected the internet gateway, the visualization indicates that traffic from the public subnets is routed to the internet because the corresponding route table sends the traffic to the internet gateway.ConceptsVPCs and subnetsDefault and nondefault VPCsRoute tablesAccess the internetAccess a corporate or home networkConnect VPCs and networksAWS private global networkVPCs and subnets
