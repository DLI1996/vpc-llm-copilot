Mirrored traffic is encapsulated in VXLAN packets and then routed to the mirror target. The security groups for a traffic mirror target must allow VXLAN traffic (UDP port 4789) from the traffic mirror source. The route table for the subnet with the traffic mirror source must have a route that sends the mirrored traffic to the traffic mirror target. The monitoring software that you run on the mirror target must be able to process encapsulated VXLAN packets.Routing and security groupsEncapsulated mirror traffic is routed to the traffic mirror target by using the VPC route table. Make sure that your route table is configured to send the mirrored traffic to the traffic mirror target.Inbound traffic that is dropped at the traffic mirror source, because of the inbound security group rules or the inbound network ACL rules, is not mirrored.
