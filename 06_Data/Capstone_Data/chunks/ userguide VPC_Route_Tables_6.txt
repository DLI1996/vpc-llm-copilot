If you frequently reference the same set of CIDR blocks across your AWS resources, you can create a customer-managed prefix list to group them together. You can then specify the prefix list as the destination in your route table entry.Every route table contains a local route for communication within the VPC. This route is added by default to all route tables. If your VPC has more than one IPv4 CIDR block, your route tables contain a local route for each IPv4 CIDR block. If you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, your route tables contain a local route for the IPv6 CIDR block. You can replace or restore the target of each local route as needed.Rules and considerations
