Check whether your DNS provider appended the domain name to the end of the TXT record. Some DNS providers automatically append the name of your domain to the attribute name of the TXT record. To avoid this duplication of the domain name, add a period to the end of the domain name when you create the TXT record. This tells your DNS provider that it isn't necessary to append the domain name to the TXT record.Check whether your DNS provider modified the DNS record value to use only lowercase letters. We verify your domain only when there is a verification record with an attribute value that exactly matches the value that we provided. If the DNS provider changed your TXT record values to use only lowercase letters, contact them for assistance.
