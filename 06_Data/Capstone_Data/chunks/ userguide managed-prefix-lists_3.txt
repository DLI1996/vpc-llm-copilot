A prefix list supports a single type of IP addressing only (IPv4 or IPv6). You cannot combine IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks in a single prefix list.A prefix list applies only to the Region where you created it.When you create a prefix list, you must specify the maximum number of entries that the prefix list can support.When you reference a prefix list in a resource, the maximum number of entries for the prefix lists counts against the quota for the number of entries for the resource. For example, if you create a prefix list with 20 maximum entries and you reference that prefix list in a security group rule, this counts as 20 security group rules.When you reference a prefix list in a route table, route priority rules apply.
