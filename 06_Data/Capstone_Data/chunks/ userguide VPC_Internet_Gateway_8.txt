Availability Zone: Optionally choose an Availability Zone or Local Zone in which your subnet will reside, or leave the default No Preference to let AWS choose an Availability Zone for you. For information about the Regions that support Local Zones, see Available Regions in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances. IPv4 CIDR block: Specify an IPv4 CIDR block for your subnet, for example, 10.0.1.0/24. For more information, see IPv4 VPC CIDR blocks.
