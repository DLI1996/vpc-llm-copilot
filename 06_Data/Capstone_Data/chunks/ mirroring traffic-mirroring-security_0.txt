Administrators control who can be authenticated (signed in) and authorized (have permissions) to use traffic mirror resources.To allow access to traffic mirror resources, you create and attach an IAM policy to an IAM role and users or groups assume that role.The IAM role must be given permission to use specific traffic mirror resources and API actions. When you attach a policy to a role, it allows or denies permission to perform the specified tasks on the specified resources.You can also use resource-level permissions to restrict what resources users can use when they invoke APIs.Example: CreateTrafficMirrorSession policy
