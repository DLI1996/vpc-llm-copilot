The following diagram shows the key components of the configuration for this scenario. Packets from VPC A, VPC B, and VPC C route to the transit gateway. Packets from the subnets in VPC A, VPC B, and VPC C that have the internet as a destination first route through the transit gateway and then route to the Site-to-Site VPN connection (if the destination is within that network). Packets from one VPC that have a destination of a subnet in another VPC, for example from 10.1.0.0 to 10.2.0.0, route through the transit gateway, where they are blocked because there is no route for them in the transit gateway route table.ResourcesCreate the following resources for this scenario:Three VPCs.
