Similar to Example: Edge consolidation, the VPC and VPNs are mapped to segments based on the attachment type. The one exception is the firewall VPC, which needs its own specific segment so that it can be shared separately with the other segments. In order to force the traffic coming in from the VPN to a firewall, static routes are configured that point to the firewall. In this case, the AWS VPCs in the Internal-apps segment are using the 172.16.0.0/16 CIDR space. All other private (RFC1918) space is advertised from the VPN connection. In this case, the policy uses the share and static-route options to define how each of the three segments receive the correct routes to send traffic through a middle box.{ "version": "2021.12", "core-network-configuration":{ "asn-ranges": ["64512-65534"], "edge-locations": [{ "location": "us-east-1"},
