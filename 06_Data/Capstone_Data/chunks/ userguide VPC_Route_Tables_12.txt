When you create a VPC, it automatically has a main route table. When a subnet does not have an explicit routing table associated with it, the main routing table is used by default. On the Route tables page in the Amazon VPC console, you can view the main route table for a VPC by looking for Yes in the Main column.By default, when you create a nondefault VPC, the main route table contains only a local route. If you Create a VPC and choose a NAT gateway, Amazon VPC automatically adds routes to the main route table for the gateways.The following rules apply to the main route table:You can add, remove, and modify routes in the main route table.You can't delete the main route table.You can't set a gateway route table as the main route table.You can replace the main route table by associating a custom route table with a subnet.
