As the internet continues to grow, so does the need for IP addresses. The most common format for IP addresses is IPv4. The new format for IP addresses is IPv6, which provides a larger address space than IPv4.AWS services support for IPv6 includes support for dual stack configuration (IPv4 and IPv6) or IPv6 only configurations. For example, a virtual private cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources. Within a VPC, you can create subnets that are IPv4 only, dual stack, or IPv6 only.
