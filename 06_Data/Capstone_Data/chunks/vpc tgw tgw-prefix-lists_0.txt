A prefix list is a set of one or more CIDR block entries that you define and manage. You can use a prefix list to simplify the management of the IP addresses that you reference in your resources to route network traffic. For example, if you frequently specify the same destination CIDRs across multiple transit gateway route tables, you can manage those CIDRs in a single prefix list, instead of repeatedly referencing the same CIDRs in each route table. If you need to remove a destination CIDR block, you can remove its entry from the prefix list instead of removing the route from every affected route table.
