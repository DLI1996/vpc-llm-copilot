When you create an IPAM, IPAM creates two default scopes for you. Each scope represents the IP space for a single network. The private scope is intended for all private space. The public scope is intended for all public space. Scopes enable you to reuse IP addresses across multiple unconnected networks without causing IP address overlap or conflict.When you create an IPAM, default scopes (one private and one public) are created for you. You can create additional private scopes. You cannot create additional public scopes.You can create additional private scopes if you require support for multiple disconnected private networks. Additional private scopes allow you to create pools and manage resources that use the same IP space.Important
