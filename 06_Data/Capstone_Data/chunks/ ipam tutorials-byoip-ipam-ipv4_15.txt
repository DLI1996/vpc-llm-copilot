Create a Regional pool within the top-level pool. --locale is required on the pool and it must be one of the operating Regions you configured when you created the IPAM. The locale is the AWS Region where you want this IPAM pool to be available for allocations. For example, you can only allocate a CIDR for a VPC from an IPAM pool that shares a locale with the VPCâ€™s Region. Note that when you have chosen a locale for a pool, you cannot modify it. If the home Region of the IPAM is unavailable due to an outage and the pool has a locale different than the home Region of the IPAM, the pool can still be used to allocate IP addresses.This step must be done by the IPAM account.
