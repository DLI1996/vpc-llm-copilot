For the Peer ASN, specify the BGP ASN for the appliance. You can use an existing ASN that's assigned to your network. If you do not have one, you can use any ASN in the 1-4294967294 range. The default is the same ASN as the core network edge. If you configure the Peer ASN to be different from the core network edge ASN (eBGP), you must configure ebgp-multihop with a time-to-live (TTL) value of 2.For Subnet, choose the subnet of the appliance. NoteWe recommend you run your appliance in the same subnet as your transport VPC attachment.
