In the preceding example, a Connect attachment is created on an existing VPC attachment (the transport attachment). A Connect peer is created on the Connect attachment to establish a connection to an appliance in the VPC. The transit gateway address is 192.0.2.1, and the range of BGP addresses is 169.254.6.0/29. The first IP address in the range (169.254.6.1) is configured on the appliance as the peer BGP IP address.The subnet route table for VPC C has a route that points traffic destined for the transit gateway CIDR block to the transit gateway.172.31.0.0/16 Local 192.0.2.0/24 tgw-idRequirements and considerationsThe following are the requirements and considerations for a Connect attachment.For information about what Regions support Connect attachments, see the AWS Transit Gateways FAQ.
