To create a flow log, you specify:The resource for which to create the flow logThe type of traffic to capture (accepted traffic, rejected traffic, or all traffic)The destinations to which you want to publish the flow log dataIn the following example, you create a flow log that captures accepted traffic for the network interface for one of the EC2 instances in a private subnet and publishes the flow log records to an Amazon S3 bucket.In the following example, a flow log captures all traffic for a subnet and publishes the flow log records to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. The flow log captures traffic for all network interfaces in the subnet.After you create a flow log, it can take several minutes to begin collecting and publishing data to the chosen destinations. Flow logs do not capture real-time log streams for your network interfaces. For more information, see Create a flow log.
