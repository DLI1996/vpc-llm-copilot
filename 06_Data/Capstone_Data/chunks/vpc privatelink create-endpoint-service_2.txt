When service consumers send traffic to a service through an interface endpoint, the source IP addresses provided to the application are the private IP addresses of the load balancer nodes, not the IP addresses of the service consumers. If you enable proxy protocol on the load balancer, you can obtain the addresses of the service consumers and the IDs of the interface endpoints from the proxy protocol header. For more information, see Proxy protocol in the User Guide for Network Load Balancers.
