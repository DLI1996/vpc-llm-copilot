In the preceding example, the CIDRs that are used are examples only. They illustrate that each pool within the top-level pool is provisioned with a portion of the top-level CIDR.When you create an IPAM pool, you can configure rules for the allocations that are made within the IPAM pool.Allocation rules enable you to configure the following:Whether IPAM should automatically import CIDRs into the IPAM pool if it finds them within this pool's CIDR rangeThe required netmask length for allocations within the poolThe required tags for resources within the poolThe required locale for resources within the pool. The locale is the AWS Region where an IPAM pool is available for allocations.Allocation rules determine whether resources are compliant or noncompliant. For additional information about compliance, see Monitor CIDR usage by resource.Important
