A Connect peer using the BGP AS-PATH attribute is the preferred route when you have two Connect peers. To use equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routing between multiple appliances, you must configure the appliance to advertise the same prefixes to the transit gateway with the same BGP AS-PATH attribute. For the transit gateway to choose all of the available ECMP paths, the AS-PATH and Autonomous System Number (ASN) must match. The transit gateway can use ECMP between Connect peers for the same Connect attachment or between Connect attachments on the same transit gateway. The transit gateway cannot use ECMP between both of the redundant BGP peerings a single peer establishes to it.With a Connect attachment, the routes are propagated to a transit gateway route table by default.Static routes are not supported.
