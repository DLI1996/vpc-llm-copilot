The following is the route table associated with the second subnet. There is a local route for each VPC CIDR. Local routes enable resources in the subnet to communicate with other resources in the VPC using private IP addresses. The third entry sends traffic destined for the on-premises network to the virtual private gateway.10.0.0.0/16 local 100.64.1.0/24 local 192.168.0.0/16 vgw-idEnable communication between overlapping networksYou can use a private NAT gateway to enable communication between networks even if they have overlapping CIDR ranges. For example, suppose that the instances in VPC A need to access the services provided by the instances in VPC B.ContentsOverviewResourcesRoutingOverview
