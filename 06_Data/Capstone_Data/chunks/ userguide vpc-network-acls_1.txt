The following diagram shows a VPC with two subnets. Each subnet has a network ACL. When traffic enters the VPC (for example, from a peered VPC, VPN connection, or the internet), the router sends the traffic to its destination. Network ACL A determines which traffic destined for subnet 1 is allowed to enter subnet 1, and which traffic destined for a location outside subnet 1 is allowed to leave subnet 1. Similarly, network ACL B determines which traffic is allowed to enter and leave subnet 2.For information about the differences between security groups and network ACLs, see Compare security groups and network ACLs.ContentsNetwork ACL basicsNetwork ACL rulesDefault network ACLCustom network ACLCustom network ACLs and other AWS servicesEphemeral portsPath MTU DiscoveryWork with network ACLsExample: Control access to instances in a subnetNetwork ACL basicsThe following are the basic things that you need to know about network ACLs:
