Route tables per VPC 200 Yes The main route table counts toward this quota. Note that if you request a quota increase for route tables, you may also want to request a quota increase for subnets. While route tables can be shared with multiple subnets, a subnet can only be associated with a single route table. Routes per route table (non-propagated routes) 50 Yes You can increase this quota up to a maximum of 1,000; however, network performance might be impacted. This quota is enforced separately for IPv4 routes and IPv6 routes. If you have more than 125 routes, we recommend that you paginate calls to describe your route tables for better performance.
