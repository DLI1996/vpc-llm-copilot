Using the IPAM admin account, open the IPAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam/.In the navigation pane, choose Pools.Choose the private scope.Choose Create pool.Under IPAM scope, leave the private scope selected.(Optional) Add a Name tag for the pool and a description for the pool, such as “Global pool”.Under Source type, choose IPAM scope. Because this is our top level pool, it will not have a source pool.For the Locale, choose None. Locales are the AWS Regions where you want this IPAM pool to be available for allocations. You’ll set the locale for the Regional pools that you create in the next section of this tutorial.Choose a CIDR to provision for the pool. In this example, we provision 10.0.0.0/16.
