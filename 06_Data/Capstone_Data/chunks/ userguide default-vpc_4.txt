Instances that you launch into a default subnet receive both a public IPv4 address and a private IPv4 address, and both public and private DNS hostnames. Instances that you launch into a nondefault subnet in a default VPC don't receive a public IPv4 address or a DNS hostname. You can change your subnet's default public IP addressing behavior. For more information, see Modify the public IPv4 addressing attribute for your subnet.From time to time, AWS may add a new Availability Zone to a Region. In most cases, we automatically create a new default subnet in this Availability Zone for your default VPC within a few days. However, if you made any modifications to your default VPC, we do not add a new default subnet. If you want a default subnet for the new Availability Zone, you can create one yourself.
