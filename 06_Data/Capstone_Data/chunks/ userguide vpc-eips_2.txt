If you associate an Elastic IP address with the eth0 network interface of your instance, its current public IPv4 address (if it had one) is released to the EC2-VPC public IP address pool. If you disassociate the Elastic IP address, the eth0 network interface is automatically assigned a new public IPv4 address within a few minutes. This doesn't apply if you've attached a second network interface to your instance.You're limited to five Elastic IP addresses. To help conserve them, you can use a NAT device. For more information, see Connect to the internet or other networks using NAT devices.Elastic IP addresses for IPv6 are not supported.You can tag an Elastic IP address that's allocated for use in a VPC, however, cost allocation tags are not supported. If you recover an Elastic IP address, tags are not recovered.
