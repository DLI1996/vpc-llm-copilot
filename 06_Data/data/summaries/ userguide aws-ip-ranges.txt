The AWS User Guide provides documentation on Amazon VPC and includes information on how to download and use the AWS IP address ranges in JSON format. The IP address ranges can be used to identify and control traffic from AWS services. The guide also provides syntax details, information on range overlaps, filtering the JSON file, implementing egress control, and receiving notifications for changes in IP address ranges. Additionally, the guide includes release notes and links to learn more about specific AWS services.
