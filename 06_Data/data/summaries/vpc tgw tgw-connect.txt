AWS Transit Gateway Connect allows you to establish a connection between a transit gateway and third-party virtual appliances running in a VPC. It uses the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel protocol and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for dynamic routing. You can create a Connect attachment to connect the transit gateway and the third-party appliance, and create one or more GRE tunnels (Connect peers) on the Connect attachment. A Connect peer consists of two BGP peering sessions for redundancy. You can view, modify, and delete Connect attachments and Connect peers. The Connect attachment uses an existing VPC or Direct Connect attachment as the transport mechanism.
