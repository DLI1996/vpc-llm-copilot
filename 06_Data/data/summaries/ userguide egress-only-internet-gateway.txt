The AWS User Guide provides documentation on how to work with egress-only internet gateways in Amazon VPC. An egress-only internet gateway allows outbound communication over IPv6 from instances in a VPC to the internet, while preventing the internet from initiating an IPv6 connection with the instances. The guide explains the basics of egress-only internet gateways, how to create and manage them, and provides information on pricing. It also includes API and CLI overviews for performing tasks related to egress-only internet gateways.
