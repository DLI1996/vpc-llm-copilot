The AWS CreateVpcEndpointConnectionNotification API allows users to create a connection notification for a specified VPC endpoint or VPC endpoint service. This notification will inform the user of specific endpoint events. The user must create an SNS topic to receive these notifications. The API supports various request parameters such as ClientToken, ConnectionEvents, ConnectionNotificationArn, DryRun, ServiceId, and VpcEndpointId. The response includes elements such as clientToken, connectionNotification, and requestId. The API also provides examples and references to language-specific AWS SDKs.
