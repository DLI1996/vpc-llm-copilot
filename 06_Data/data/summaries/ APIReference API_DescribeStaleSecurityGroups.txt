The AWS API Reference for Amazon EC2 provides documentation on the DescribeStaleSecurityGroups action. This action is used to retrieve information about stale security group rules in a specified VPC. Stale rules are those that reference deleted security groups in the same VPC or in a peer VPC, or reference a security group in a peer VPC where the VPC peering connection has been deleted. The action requires the VPC ID as a parameter and returns information about the stale security groups, including a token for pagination and the request ID. The documentation also includes examples and links to language-specific AWS SDKs for using the API.
