The AWS Network Manager allows users to create, delete, and edit shared peerings for core networks. By accessing the Network Manager console, users can create new peering attachments, view current attachments, and delete attachments from shared core networks. Users must have specific permissions in order to create a peering. To delete a shared peering, users can select the peering ID and choose the delete option. Additionally, users can edit the tags associated with a shared peering by selecting the peering ID and choosing the edit tags option.
