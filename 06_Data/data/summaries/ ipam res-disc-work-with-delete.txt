This section of the AWS documentation explains how to delete a resource discovery in Amazon VPC's IP Address Manager (IPAM). It notes that default resource discoveries cannot be deleted, but they are deleted if the IPAM is deleted. The process of deleting a resource discovery is described, and it is specified that this step must be completed by the Secondary Org Admin Account. The documentation provides a link to the IPAM console where the resource discovery can be deleted. It also mentions that the AWS CLI Reference documentation provides more detailed descriptions of the options available when running the commands.
