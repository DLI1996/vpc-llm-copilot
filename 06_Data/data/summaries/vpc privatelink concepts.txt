AWS PrivateLink is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows resources in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to securely connect to services in other VPCs using private IP addresses. It enables service providers to make their services available in a region and service consumers to access these services. Service providers create endpoint services and service consumers create VPC endpoints to connect to these services. Private hosted zones and endpoint policies can be used to control access to the services. The connections between VPC endpoints and endpoint services are private and do not traverse the public internet.
