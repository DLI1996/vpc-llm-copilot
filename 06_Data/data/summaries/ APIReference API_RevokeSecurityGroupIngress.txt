The AWS RevokeSecurityGroupIngress API allows users to remove inbound rules from a security group. Users can specify rules using either rule IDs or security group rule properties. The API provides various request parameters such as CIDR IP address range, protocol, port range, security group ID, and more. The response includes the request ID, a boolean indicating success or failure, and any unknown inbound rules. The API is available in multiple AWS SDKs and can be used with the AWS Command Line Interface.
