This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to bring your own IPv6 CIDR to IPAM (IP Address Manager) using the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface). It covers creating AWS CLI named profiles and IAM roles, creating an IPAM, creating an IPAM pool, provisioning CIDRs to the top-level and regional pools, sharing the regional pool, creating a VPC using the IPv6 CIDR, advertising the CIDR, and cleaning up the resources. The document assumes that certain prerequisites have already been completed, such as integrating IPAM with AWS Organization accounts and creating an IPAM.
