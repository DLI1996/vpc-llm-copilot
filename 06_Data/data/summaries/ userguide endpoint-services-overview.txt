AWS PrivateLink allows for private connectivity between virtual private clouds (VPC) and supported AWS services, services hosted by other AWS accounts, and supported AWS Marketplace services. It eliminates the need for internet gateways, NAT devices, AWS Direct Connect connections, or AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections. Users can create VPC endpoints in their VPCs to establish private connectivity with services. They can also create their own VPC endpoint service to allow other AWS customers to access their service.
