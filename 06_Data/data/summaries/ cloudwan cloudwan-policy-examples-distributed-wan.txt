This document provides an example of a distributed wide area network (WAN) without VPCs using AWS Network Manager. The WAN is used for transport between sites and internet access for sales offices, but does not have connectivity to AWS workloads. The IoT network is isolated for security reasons, but engineering sites and parts of the IoT network have deployed SD-WAN for direct access. The SD-WAN network uses the AWS backbone for transport when crossing the engineering and IoT segments. The document also includes configuration details and attachment policies for the network.
