This documentation provides information about AWS PrivateLink and how to control access to VPC endpoints using endpoint policies. An endpoint policy is a JSON policy document that allows you to specify which AWS principals can use the endpoint to access an AWS service. The documentation includes considerations, default endpoint policy, policies for interface endpoints, principals for gateway endpoints, and instructions on how to update a VPC endpoint policy. It also provides examples of endpoint policies for different AWS services.
