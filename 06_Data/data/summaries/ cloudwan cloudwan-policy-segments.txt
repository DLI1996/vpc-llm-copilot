AWS Network Manager allows users to divide their global network into separate isolated networks called segments. Each segment creates a dedicated routing domain, and resources connected to the same segment can only communicate within that segment. Users can also choose to isolate resources within a segment, allowing them access only to shared services. AWS Network Manager ensures consistent configuration across AWS Regions, eliminating the need for manual synchronization. To configure a segment, users can access the Network Manager console and follow the provided steps.
