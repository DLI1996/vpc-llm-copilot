AWS PrivateLink allows AWS customers to share their own services with other customers by hosting them as endpoint services. This can be done by creating a Network Load Balancer in the customer's VPC and granting permission to specific AWS principals. Service consumers can then create interface VPC endpoints to connect to the service. DNS hostnames are generated for the endpoint service and can be associated with a private DNS name. The service endpoints can be made available over IPv4, IPv6, or both. There are specific requirements for enabling IPv6 for an endpoint service or interface endpoint. The DNS record IP address type determines the DNS records that are created for the interface endpoint.
