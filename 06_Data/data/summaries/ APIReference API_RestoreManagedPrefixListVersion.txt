The AWS API Reference provides documentation for the RestoreManagedPrefixListVersion action in Amazon EC2. This action allows users to restore the entries from a previous version of a managed prefix list to a new version of the prefix list. The action requires parameters such as the current version number, prefix list ID, and the version to restore. The response includes information about the prefix list and a request ID. The documentation also provides examples and links to language-specific AWS SDKs for further information on using the API.
