The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service allows administrators to control access to AWS resources. This includes managing access to Amazon VPC resources. IAM provides authentication and authorization for users, groups, and roles. Users can authenticate using various methods, such as federated identities or IAM user credentials. Access to resources is managed through policies, which define permissions for actions on resources. IAM supports different types of policies, including identity-based policies and resource-based policies. Administrators can create and manage IAM policies to grant permissions to users and roles. IAM also supports other policy types, such as permissions boundaries, service control policies, and session policies.
