This documentation is about the AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways API, specifically the AssociateCustomerGateway operation. This operation allows you to associate a customer gateway with a device and optionally with a link. The customer gateway must be connected to a VPN attachment on a transit gateway or core network registered in your global network. The request requires the global network ID, customer gateway ARN, device ID, and link ID (optional). The response includes the customer gateway association details. Possible errors include access denied, conflict, internal server error, resource not found, service quota exceeded, throttling, and validation failure.
