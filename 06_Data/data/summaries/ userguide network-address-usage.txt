The AWS User Guide provides documentation on Amazon VPC and how to calculate Network Address Usage (NAU) for your VPC. NAU is a metric used to plan and monitor the size of your VPC. The guide explains how NAU is calculated for different resources in your VPC, such as network interfaces, load balancers, and lambda functions. It also provides examples of how to calculate NAU for VPCs connected through peering or a transit gateway. Understanding NAU is important to ensure your VPC does not exceed the NAU quota limits set by AWS.
