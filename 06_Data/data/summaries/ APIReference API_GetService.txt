This is a summary of the documentation for the AWS GetService API. The API allows users to retrieve information about a specified service. The request requires the service identifier as a parameter and does not have a request body. The response includes various elements such as the ARN, authentication type, certificate ARN, creation date, custom domain name, DNS entry, failure code and message, ID, last update date, name, and status of the service. The API may return errors such as AccessDeniedException, InternalServerException, ResourceNotFoundException, ThrottlingException, or ValidationException. The documentation also provides links to additional resources for using the API in different programming languages.
