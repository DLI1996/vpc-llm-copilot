The AWS User Guide provides documentation on Amazon VPC and its default components. A default VPC is automatically created in each AWS Region and includes a public subnet in each Availability Zone, an internet gateway, and DNS resolution settings. Default VPCs are suitable for quickly getting started and launching public instances. Users can modify the components of their default VPC as needed. The guide also explains how to view, create, and delete default VPCs and subnets, as well as how to use them like any other VPC.
