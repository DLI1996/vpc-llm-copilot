The AWS API Reference for the DescribeVpcPeeringConnections action provides information on how to describe one or more VPC peering connections. It includes details on the request parameters, response elements, errors, and examples. The API allows users to filter the results based on various criteria such as accepter VPC info, requester VPC info, status code, and tags. The maximum number of items to return can also be specified. The response includes information on the next token, request ID, and the VPC peering connections. The documentation also provides links to language-specific AWS SDKs for further assistance.
