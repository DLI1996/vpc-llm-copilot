This documentation is about the AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways API, specifically the GetResourcePolicy operation. It provides information on how to make a request to retrieve a resource policy for a specified resource. The request requires the resource ARN as a parameter and does not have a request body. The response includes the policy document in JSON format. The documentation also lists the possible errors that can occur during the operation. Additionally, it provides links to other resources for using the API in different programming languages.
