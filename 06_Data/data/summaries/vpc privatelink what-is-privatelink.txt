AWS PrivateLink is a technology that allows you to privately connect your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to services as if they were in your VPC. It eliminates the need for internet gateways, NAT devices, public IP addresses, AWS Direct Connect connections, or AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections. You can create VPC endpoints to connect resources in your VPC to services that integrate with AWS PrivateLink. You can manage VPC endpoints using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, AWS CloudFormation, AWS SDKs, or the Query API. For pricing information, refer to AWS PrivateLink Pricing.
