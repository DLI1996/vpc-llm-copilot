This section of the AWS documentation explains how to integrate an IP Address Manager (IPAM) with AWS accounts outside of your organization. The process involves four AWS accounts: the primary organization owner, the primary organization IPAM account, the secondary organization owner, and the secondary organization admin account. The steps include delegating IPAM accounts, creating resource discoveries, accepting resource share invitations, associating resource discoveries with IPAM, and optionally sharing IPAM pools and stopping resource discoveries. The documentation also mentions that JavaScript must be enabled to use the AWS documentation.
