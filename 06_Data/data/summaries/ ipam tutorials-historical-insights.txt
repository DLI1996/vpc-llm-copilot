This documentation provides an overview of using the AWS CLI to analyze and audit IP address usage in Amazon VPC using the IP Address Manager (IPAM) feature. It includes several scenarios with commands to retrieve historical data for different types of resources such as VPCs, subnets, Elastic IP addresses, EC2 instances, and EC2 network interfaces. The examples demonstrate how to query for specific IP addresses within a given time period and view the results of the analysis. The documentation also mentions important considerations and limitations when using IPAM and the AWS CLI.
