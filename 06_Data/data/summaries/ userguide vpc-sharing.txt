AWS VPC sharing allows multiple AWS accounts within the same organization to create and manage their application resources in shared VPCs. The owner of the VPC can share one or more subnets with other accounts, allowing them to view, create, modify, and delete their own resources within the shared subnets. Participants cannot access or modify resources owned by other participants or the VPC owner. VPC sharing helps simplify network topologies and reduces the number of VPCs that need to be managed. Participants are responsible for their own resources and pay for their usage, while the VPC owner is responsible for creating and managing the shared VPC resources. There are certain permissions and restrictions for owners and participants when it comes to managing VPC resources. VPC sharing quotas exist and there are specific steps to share and unshare subnets within a VPC.
