AWS PrivateLink allows users to access SaaS products privately through their own VPC. Users can create an interface endpoint to connect to the SaaS product by following the provided procedure. The service provider creates an endpoint service and grants customers access to it, while the service consumer creates an interface VPC endpoint to establish connections between their VPC and the endpoint service. Users can find SaaS products powered by AWS PrivateLink through AWS Marketplace or from AWS Partners.
