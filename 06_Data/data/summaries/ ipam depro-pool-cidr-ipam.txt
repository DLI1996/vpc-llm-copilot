This documentation provides instructions on how to deprovision CIDRs from an IP Address Manager (IPAM) pool in Amazon VPC. It explains that deprovisioning CIDRs removes them from the pool and makes the pool unavailable for allocations. The documentation also mentions that you cannot deprovision a CIDR if there are allocations in the pool and provides links to commands in the AWS CLI Reference documentation for deprovisioning a pool CIDR. Additionally, it mentions that to use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, JavaScript must be enabled in the browser.
