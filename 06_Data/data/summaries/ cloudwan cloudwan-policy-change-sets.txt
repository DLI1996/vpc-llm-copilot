The AWS Network Manager allows users to manage policies for their AWS Cloud WAN. Users can update, view, compare, deploy, restore, delete, and download policy versions. When updating a policy version, a change set is created for review. Users can also view proposed changes to a policy before deploying them. The Network Manager console provides the ability to compare policy change set versions and deploy a policy version as the new live policy. Out-of-date policies can be restored as new versions, and any policy except the current live policy can be deleted. Policies can be downloaded as JSON files for editing and creating new policy versions.
