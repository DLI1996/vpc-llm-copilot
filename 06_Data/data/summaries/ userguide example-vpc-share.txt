This documentation explains how to share public and private subnets in Amazon VPC. It provides a scenario where Account A manages the infrastructure and shares the subnets with Account B, Account C, and Account D. Each account can only see and create resources in the subnets that are shared with them. The documentation also mentions that there is no additional configuration required for shared subnets.
