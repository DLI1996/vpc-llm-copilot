This documentation is about the AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways API, specifically the DeleteResourcePolicy action. This action is used to delete a resource policy for a specified resource, which revokes access for the principals specified in the policy. The request syntax includes URI request parameters, such as the ARN of the policy to delete. The request does not have a request body. If the action is successful, an HTTP 200 response with an empty body is returned. There are several possible errors that can occur, such as AccessDeniedException, ConflictException, InternalServerException, ThrottlingException, and ValidationException. The documentation also provides links to additional resources, such as the AWS Command Line Interface and various AWS SDKs.
