This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to bring your own IPv6 CIDR to IPAM (IP Address Manager) using AWS (Amazon Web Services). It includes instructions on creating a top-level IPAM pool, creating a regional pool within the top-level pool, sharing the regional pool, creating a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), advertising the CIDR, and performing cleanup tasks. The tutorial assumes that certain prerequisites have already been completed and that the steps are performed by specific AWS Organization accounts.
