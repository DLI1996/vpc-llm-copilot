The AWS Network Manager allows users to view CloudWatch metrics for their global network. Users can filter metrics by transit gateway or view metrics for a specific transit gateway and its attachments. The process for viewing these metrics is outlined in the AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways User Guide. Additionally, users have the option to add metrics to their CloudWatch dashboard. However, this feature is only available for transit gateways registered in the US West (Oregon) Region.
