AWS Network Manager's Infrastructure Performance feature allows users to monitor network latency in near real-time and historical data across AWS Regions and Availability Zones. This feature helps users evaluate network performance and identify any degradation that may affect their applications. Infrastructure Performance also supports publishing metrics to Amazon CloudWatch for easy viewing. It does not provide specific details about the causes of degradation. This feature is available in certain geographical areas and does not include performance metrics for VPC networking resources.
