It includes details on the request parameters, response elements, errors, and examples. The action allows users to retrieve information about NAT gateways based on various filters such as NAT gateway ID, state, subnet ID, tag, and VPC ID. The maximum number of items to return can also be specified. The response includes information about the NAT gateways, a token for pagination, and the request ID. The documentation also provides links to language-specific AWS SDKs for further assistance.
