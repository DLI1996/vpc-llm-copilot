The AWS Network Manager allows users to create a transit gateway Connect attachment to establish a connection between a core network edge and third-party virtual appliances running in Amazon VPC. This attachment supports both the GRE tunnel protocol and the Tunnel-less Connect protocol for high performance, as well as BGP for dynamic routing. Users can create a Connect attachment using the console, command line, or API. Tunnel-less Connect provides a simpler way to build a global SD-WAN using AWS, allowing third-party SD-WAN appliances to peer with Cloud WAN using BGP without the need for IPsec or GRE-based tunnels. Tunnel-less Connect uses BGP for dynamic routing and supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address families. Users can configure the VPC route table for Tunnel-less Connect and there are limitations for third-party appliances located in the same subnet as the Cloud WAN VPC attachment or in different subnets. The documentation provides step-by-step instructions for adding a Connect attachment using the console and command line/API.
