AWS Cloud WAN allows users to interconnect their core network edge with an AWS Transit Gateway in the same region. Peering connections between Cloud WAN and transit gateways support dynamic routing with automatic exchange of routes using BGP. Users can create, view, and delete peerings, as well as edit peering tags. Route evaluation in Cloud WAN follows a specific order, and there are limitations when creating a transit gateway peering connection. The documentation provides step-by-step instructions on how to create, view, delete, and edit peering connections in AWS Cloud WAN.
