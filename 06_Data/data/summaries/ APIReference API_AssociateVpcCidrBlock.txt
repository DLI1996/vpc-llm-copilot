The AWS AssociateVpcCidrBlock API allows you to associate a CIDR block with your VPC. You can associate an IPv4 CIDR block, an Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block, or an IPv6 CIDR block from an IPv6 address pool. The API provides various request parameters such as AmazonProvidedIpv6CidrBlock, CidrBlock, Ipv4IpamPoolId, Ipv4NetmaskLength, Ipv6CidrBlock, Ipv6CidrBlockNetworkBorderGroup, Ipv6IpamPoolId, Ipv6NetmaskLength, and VpcId. The response includes information about the CIDR block association, the request ID, and the VPC ID. The API also provides examples and references to other related APIs.
