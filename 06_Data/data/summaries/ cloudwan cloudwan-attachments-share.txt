The AWS Network Manager allows users to create and manage shared VPC and transit gateway route table attachments. Users can view and delete shared attachments, as well as create new attachments. The process for creating shared VPC and transit gateway attachments involves accessing the Network Manager console, selecting the appropriate core network and edge location, and providing necessary details such as name, attachment type, and IPv6 support. Users can also view details about their shared attachments and edit certain information if needed. To delete shared attachments, users can select the attachment and choose the delete option.
