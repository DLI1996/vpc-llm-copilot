This document provides information about DNS64 and NAT64 in the context of Amazon VPC. DNS64 is a feature that allows IPv6-only workloads in VPCs to communicate with IPv4-only services by synthesizing IPv6 addresses. NAT64, on the other hand, enables communication between IPv6-only services and IPv4-only services within the same VPC or connected VPCs, as well as in on-premises networks or over the internet. The document also includes instructions on how to configure DNS64 and NAT64 using the AWS CLI.
