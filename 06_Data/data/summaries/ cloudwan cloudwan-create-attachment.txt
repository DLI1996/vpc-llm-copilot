The AWS Network Manager allows users to attach a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to a core network edge. This attachment requires specifying one subnet from each Availability Zone to route traffic. Attachment states can be in the process of creation, deletion, or waiting for network updates or tag acceptance. The supported core network attachment types include Connect, Connect peer, Transit gateway route table, VPC, and VPN. Users can create attachments using the Network Manager console or through the command line/API.
