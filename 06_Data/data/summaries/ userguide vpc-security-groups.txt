This document is a user guide for Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) in AWS (Amazon Web Services). It explains how to control traffic to AWS resources using security groups. A security group is associated with resources in a VPC and controls inbound and outbound traffic for those resources. The guide also mentions that there is no additional charge for using security groups. It provides a diagram illustrating the use of security groups in a VPC with subnets in two Availability Zones. The document also mentions the availability of default security groups for VPCs and provides a link to compare security groups and network ACLs.
