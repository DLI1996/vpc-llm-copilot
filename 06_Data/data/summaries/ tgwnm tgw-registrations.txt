This documentation is about AWS Network Manager and specifically focuses on registering, viewing, and deregistering transit gateways in a global network. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to perform these tasks using the Network Manager console or the AWS CLI. It also mentions that transit gateways and their attachments cannot be created, deleted, or modified using the Network Manager console or APIs, and instead, the Amazon VPC console or the Amazon EC2 APIs should be used.
