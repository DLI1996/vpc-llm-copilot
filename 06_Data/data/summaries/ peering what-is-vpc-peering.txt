VPC peering is a networking connection between two virtual private clouds (VPCs) in AWS that allows for communication between instances as if they are in the same network. It can be established between VPCs within the same AWS account or with a VPC in another account, even across different AWS Regions. VPC peering uses the existing infrastructure of a VPC and does not rely on separate hardware. It is a cost-effective way to share resources between regions or replicate data for geographic redundancy. There is no charge to create a VPC peering connection, but data transfer between VPCs in different Availability Zones or Regions incurs charges.
