The AWS CreateRoute API allows users to create a route in a route table within a VPC. The API requires users to specify a destination CIDR block or a prefix list ID, as well as one resource from the parameter list. The API determines how to route traffic based on the most specific match. The API provides various request parameters and returns elements such as the request ID and a boolean value indicating success. The API also provides examples and references to related documentation.
