AWS Network Manager provides a Route Analyzer tool that allows users to analyze the routes in their transit gateway route tables. This tool helps verify route table configurations, validate existing route configurations, and diagnose route-related issues in a global network. Users can specify the source and destination for the route analysis, and optionally include middlebox appliances in the routing path. The Route Analyzer only analyzes routes in transit gateway route tables and does not analyze security group rules or network ACL rules. To perform a route analysis, users can access the AWS Global Networks for Transit Gateways console and follow the provided steps. Two examples are provided to demonstrate how to use the Route Analyzer for different scenarios.
