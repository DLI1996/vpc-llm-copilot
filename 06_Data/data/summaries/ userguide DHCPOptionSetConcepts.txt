This documentation explains the concept of DHCP option sets in Amazon VPC. A DHCP option set is a group of network settings used by resources in a VPC to communicate over the virtual network. Each VPC has a default DHCP option set, which includes settings such as domain name servers and domain name. If a VPC has no DHCP option set, the instances in the VPC cannot access the internet. Users can also create custom DHCP option sets with their own settings. Instances launched in a VPC can use either the default or custom DHCP option set to interact with DNS, NTP, and NetBIOS servers and connect to other devices in the network.
