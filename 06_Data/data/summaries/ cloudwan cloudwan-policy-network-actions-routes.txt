The AWS Network Manager allows users to create and manage network segments. Users can use segment actions to share segments or create routes. The process involves accessing the Network Manager console, choosing the Cloud WAN option, selecting the desired global network and core network, and then creating policy versions. Users can choose to create shared segments or segment routes, and can also add attachment policies.
