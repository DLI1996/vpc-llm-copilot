The AWS Cloud WAN User Guide provides documentation on how to use the AWS Network Manager to visualize and monitor global and core networks. The guide explains how to use the dashboard visualizations, including world maps, monitoring data, event tracking, and topological and logical diagrams. There are separate dashboards for global networks and core networks. The guide also mentions that JavaScript must be enabled to use the Amazon Web Services Documentation.
