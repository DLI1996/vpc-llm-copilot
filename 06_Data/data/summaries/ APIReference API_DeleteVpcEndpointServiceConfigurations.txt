The AWS API reference documentation provides information on how to delete VPC endpoint service configurations using the DeleteVpcEndpointServiceConfigurations API. This action requires the ServiceId parameter, which is an array of strings representing the IDs of the services to be deleted. The response includes the requestId and any unsuccessful service configurations that were not deleted. The documentation also provides examples and links to language-specific AWS SDKs for further assistance.
