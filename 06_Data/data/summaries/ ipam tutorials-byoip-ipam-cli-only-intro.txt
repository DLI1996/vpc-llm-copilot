This documentation provides instructions on how to bring your own public IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR to IPAM (IP Address Manager) using only the AWS CLI. It includes steps to authorize Amazon to advertise your IP address range, create a certificate for Amazon verification, and create an ROA (Route Origin Authorization) object in your RIR (Regional Internet Registry). The maximum length of an IP address prefix for IPv4 CIDRs must be /24, while for IPv6 CIDRs it must be /48. This allows for flexibility in dividing and distributing your public IP address across AWS Regions.
