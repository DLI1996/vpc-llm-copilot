Three VPC attachments on the transit gateway. The CIDR blocks for each VPC propagate to the transit gateway route table. For more information, see Create a transit gateway attachment to a VPC. For VPC C, you must create the attachment using the private subnet. If you create the attachment using the public subnet, the instance traffic is routed to the internet gateway, but the internet gateway drops the traffic because the instances don't have public IP addresses. By placing the attachment in the private subnet, the traffic is routed to the NAT gateway, and the NAT gateway sends the traffic to the internet gateway using its Elastic IP address as the source IP address.RoutingThere are route tables for each VPC and a route table for the transit gateway.Route tablesVPC AVPC BVPC CTransit gatewayRoute table for VPC A
