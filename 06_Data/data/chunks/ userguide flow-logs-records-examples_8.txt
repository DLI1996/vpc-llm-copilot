The following custom flow log for the NAT gateway network interface captures the following fields in the following order.The flow log shows the flow of traffic from the instance IP address (10.0.1.5) through the NAT gateway network interface to a host on the internet (203.0.113.5). The NAT gateway network interface is a requester-managed network interface, therefore the flow log record displays a '-' symbol for the instance-id field. The following line shows traffic from the source instance to the NAT gateway network interface. The values for the dstaddr and pkt-dstaddr fields are different. The dstaddr field displays the private IP address of the NAT gateway network interface, and the pkt-dstaddr field displays the final destination IP address of the host on the internet.
