AWSDocumentationAmazon VPCUser GuideSecurity best practices for your VPCThe following best practices are general guidelines and donâ€™t represent a complete security solution. Because these best practices might not be appropriate or sufficient for your environment, treat them as helpful considerations rather than prescriptions.When you add subnets to your VPC to host your application, create them in multiple Availability Zones. An Availability Zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region. Using multiple Availability Zones makes your production applications highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable.
