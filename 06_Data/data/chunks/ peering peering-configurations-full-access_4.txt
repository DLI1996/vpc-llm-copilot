VPC B and VPC C can't send traffic directly to each other through a VPC A, because VPC peering does not support transitive peering relationships. You can create a VPC peering connection between VPC B and VPC C, as shown in Three VPCs peered together. For more information about unsupported peering scenarios, see VPC peering limitations.You might use this configuration when you have resources on a central VPC, such as a repository of services, that other VPCs need to access. The other VPCs do not need access to each others' resources; they only need to access resources in the central VPC.Update the route table for each VPC as follows to implement this configuration using one CIDR block per VPC.
