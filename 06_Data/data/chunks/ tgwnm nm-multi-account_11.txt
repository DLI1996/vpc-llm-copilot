During this time you won't be able to register any new delegated administrators.Disable trusted accessDisabling trusted access removes the trust relationship between the Network Manager service access and your organization. Network Manager is no longer able to perform actions within your organization or access information about your organization. Trusted access remains for AWS CloudFormation StackSets in the event that your organization is using that service outside of Network Manager. For more information on disabling AWS CloudFormation StackSets, see Disabling trusted access with AWS CloudFormation Stacksets in the AWS Organizations User Guide.
