Choose the locale for the pool. Choosing a locale ensures there are no cross-region dependencies between your pool and the resources allocating from it. The available options come from the operating Regions that you chose when you created your IPAM. The locale is the AWS Region where you want this IPAM pool to be available for allocations. For example, you can only allocate a CIDR for a VPC from an IPAM pool that shares a locale with the VPC’s Region. Note that when you have chosen a locale for a pool, you cannot modify it. If the home Region of the IPAM is unavailable due to an outage and the pool has a locale different than the home Region of the IPAM, the pool can still be used to allocate IP addresses. (Optional) Choose a CIDR to provision for the pool. You can create a pool without a CIDR, but you won’t be able to use the pool
