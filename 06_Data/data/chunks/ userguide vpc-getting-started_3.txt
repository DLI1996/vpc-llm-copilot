An AWS Region is a physical location where we cluster data centers, known as Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security, with redundant power, networking, and connectivity. The Availability Zones in a Region are physically separated by a meaningful distance, and interconnected through high-bandwidth, low-latency networking. You can design your application to run in multiple Availability Zones to achieve even greater fault tolerance.Production environmentFor a production environment, we recommend that you select at least two Availability Zones and deploy your AWS resources evenly in each active Availability Zone.Development or test environmentFor a development or test environment, you might choose to save money by deploying your resources in only one Availability Zone.Plan your internet connectivity
