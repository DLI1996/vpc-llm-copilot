0.0.0.0/0 nat-gateway-idYou can also create more specific routes to other targets to avoid unnecessary data processing charges for using a NAT gateway, or to route certain traffic privately. In the following example, Amazon S3 traffic (pl-xxxxxxxx; a specific IP address range for Amazon S3) is routed to a gateway VPC endpoint, and 10.25.0.0/16 traffic is routed to a VPC peering connection. The pl-xxxxxxxx and 10.25.0.0/16 IP address ranges are more specific than 0.0.0.0/0. When instances send traffic to Amazon S3 or the peer VPC, the traffic is sent to the gateway VPC endpoint or the VPC peering connection. All other traffic is sent to the NAT gateway.
