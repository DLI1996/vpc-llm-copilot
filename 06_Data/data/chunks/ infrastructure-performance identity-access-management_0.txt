IAM administrators control who can be authenticated (signed in) and authorized (have permissions) to use Infrastructure Performance resources. IAM is an AWS service that you can use with no additional charge.To use Infrastructure Performance, you'll need an AWS account and AWS credentials. To increase the security of your AWS account, we recommend that you use an IAM user to provide access credentials instead of using your AWS account credentials.
