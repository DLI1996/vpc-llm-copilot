Create a route in the route table for the private subnet that sends all IPv4 traffic to the NAT gateway by using the following create-route command. Use the ID of the route table for the private subnet, which you created either in this step or in step 5. aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id rtb-id-private --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 --gateway-id nat-id (Optional) If you already associated a route table with the private subnet in step 5, skip this step. Otherwise, use the following associate-route-table command to associate the route table with the private subnet. Use the ID of the route table for the private subnet, which you created either in this step or in step 5. aws ec2 associate-route-table --route-table-id rtb-id-private --subnet-id subnet-id-private-subnet
