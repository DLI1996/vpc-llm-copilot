You can create additional route tables inside the transit gateway, and change the VPC or VPN association to these route tables. This enables you to segment your network. For example, you can associate development VPCs with one route table and production VPCs with a different route table. This enables you to create isolated networks inside a transit gateway similar to virtual routing and forwarding (VRFs) in traditional networks.Transit gateways support dynamic and static routing between attached VPCs and VPN connections. You can enable or disable route propagation for each attachment. Transit gateway peering attachments support static routing only.
