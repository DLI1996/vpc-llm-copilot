If you plan to configure a stateful network appliance in your VPC, you can enable appliance mode support for the VPC attachment in which the appliance is located. This ensures that the transit gateway uses the same Availability Zone for that VPC attachment for the lifetime of a flow of traffic between source and destination. It also allows the transit gateway to send traffic to any Availability Zone in the VPC, as long as there is a subnet association in that zone.
