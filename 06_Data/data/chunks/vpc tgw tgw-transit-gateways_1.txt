You can enable multicast on a transit gateway, and then create a transit gateway multicast domain that allows multicast traffic to be sent from your multicast source to multicast group members over VPC attachments that you associate with the domain.Each VPC or VPN attachment is associated with a single route table. That route table decides the next hop for the traffic coming from that resource attachment. A route table inside the transit gateway allows for both IPv4 or IPv6 CIDRs and targets. The targets are VPCs and VPN connections. When you attach a VPC or create a VPN connection on a transit gateway, the attachment is associated with the default route table of the transit gateway.
