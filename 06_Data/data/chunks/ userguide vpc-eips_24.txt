AddressLimitExceeded: If your transfer account has exceeded the Elastic IP address quota, the source account can enable Elastic IP address transfer, but this exception occurs when the transfer account tries to accept the transfer. By default, all AWS accounts are limited to 5 Elastic IP addresses per Region. See Elastic IP address limit in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances for instructions on increasing the limit.
