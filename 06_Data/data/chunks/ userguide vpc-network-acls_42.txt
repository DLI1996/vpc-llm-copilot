Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.In the navigation pane, choose Network ACLs.In the details pane, choose either the Inbound Rules or Outbound Rules tab, depending on the type of rule that you need to add, and then choose Edit.In Rule #, enter a rule number (for example, 100). The rule number must not already be in use in the network ACL. We process the rules in order, starting with the lowest number. We recommend that you leave gaps between the rule numbers (such as 100, 200, 300), rather than using sequential numbers (101, 102, 103). This makes it easier add a new rule without having to renumber the existing rules.
