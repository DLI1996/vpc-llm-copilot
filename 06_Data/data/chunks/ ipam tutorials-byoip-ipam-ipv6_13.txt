Step 4: Provision a CIDR to the top-level poolProvision a CIDR block to the top-level pool. Note that when provisioning an IPv6 CIDR to a pool within the top-level pool, the minimum IPv6 CIDR you can provision for an advertisable IPAM pool is /48; more specific CIDRs (such as /49) are not permitted. The minimum CIDR you can bring in for an non-advertisable IPAM pool is /56; more specific CIDRs (such as /57) are not permitted. You must include the CIDR and the BYOIP message and certificate signature in the request so we can verify that you own the public space. For a list of BYOIP prerequisites including how to get this BYOIP message and certificate signature, see Bring your own public IPv4 CIDR to IPAM using only the AWS CLI.
