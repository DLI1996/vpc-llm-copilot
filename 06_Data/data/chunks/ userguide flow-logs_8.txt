When publishing flow log data to Amazon S3, the data type for the fields depends on the flow log format. If the format is plain text, all fields are of type STRING. If the format is Parquet, see the table for the field data types.If a field is not applicable or could not be computed for a specific record, the record displays a '-' symbol for that entry. Metadata fields that do not come directly from the packet header are best effort approximations, and their values might be missing or inaccurate.
