When you create your core network, you also create the core network policy that deploys your network structure as it sets up the permissions. When the core network has been created, you can then create attachments within the network, and set up transit gateways and devices. At any time, you can also modify your policy and deploy a new version to better suit your business needs. For steps to create a new version of a policy, see Create a core network policy version.NoteYou can only have one core network for each of your global networks.
