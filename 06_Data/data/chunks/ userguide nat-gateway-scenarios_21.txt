Associate the assigned routable IP address ranges with their respective VPCs.Create a subnet in VPC A from its routable IP address range, and create a private NAT gateway in this new subnet.Create a subnet in VPC B from its routable IP address range, and create an Application Load Balancer in this new subnet. Register the instances in the non-routable subnet with the target group for the load balancer.Create a transit gateway to connect the VPCs. Be sure to disable route propagation. When you attach each VPC to the transit gateway, use the routable address range of the VPC.
