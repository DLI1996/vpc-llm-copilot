If the destination of a propagated route is identical to the destination of a static route, the static route takes priority if the target is one of the following:internet gatewayNAT gatewayNetwork interfaceInstance IDGateway VPC endpointTransit gatewayVPC peering connectionGateway Load Balancer endpointFor more information, see Route tables and VPN route priority in the AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide.The following example route table has a static route to an internet gateway and a propagated route to a virtual private gateway. Both routes have a destination of 172.31.0.0/24. Because a static route to an internet gateway takes priority, all traffic destined for 172.31.0.0/24 is routed to the internet gateway.
