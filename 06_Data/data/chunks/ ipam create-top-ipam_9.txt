The CIDRs that will be allocated for these resources must not already be allocated to other resources in order for the import to succeed.IPAM will import a CIDR regardless of its compliance with the pool's allocation rules, so a resource might be imported and subsequently marked as noncompliant.If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs that overlap, IPAM will import the largest CIDR only.If IPAM discovers multiple CIDRs with matching CIDRs, IPAM will randomly import one of them only.
