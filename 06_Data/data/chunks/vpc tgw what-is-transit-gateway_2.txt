Transit gateway route table — A transit gateway has a default route table and can optionally have additional route tables. A route table includes dynamic and static routes that decide the next hop based on the destination IP address of the packet. The target of these routes could be any transit gateway attachment. By default, transit gateway attachments are associated with the default transit gateway route table.Associations — Each attachment is associated with exactly one route table. Each route table can be associated with zero to many attachments.
