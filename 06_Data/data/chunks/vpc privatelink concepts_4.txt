GatewayLoadBalancer - Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to send traffic to a fleet of virtual appliances using private IP addresses. You route traffic from your VPC to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint using route tables. The Gateway Load Balancer distributes traffic to the virtual appliances and can scale with demand.There is another type of VPC endpoint, Gateway, which creates a gateway endpoint to send traffic to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB. Gateway endpoints do not use AWS PrivateLink, unlike the other types of VPC endpoints.
