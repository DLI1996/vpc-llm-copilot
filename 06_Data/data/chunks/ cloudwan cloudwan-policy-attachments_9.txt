Rule numbers are manually assigned to each attachment policy for rule processing. Rules are then processed in numerical order according to the number assigned to them. In this example, the following rule numbers are used: 100 for DevelopmentSegment, 200 for TestingSegment, and 300 for ProductionSegment. This indicates that rule 100 will be run first, followed by rule 200 and then rule 300. Once an attachment matches a rule, no further rules are processed for that attachment. Rule 300 for ProductionSegment additionally indicates that the policy will only accept vpc attachments and only if the request comes from us-east-2.For more information on the parameters used in the JSON file, see Core network policy parameters.
