For S3 bucket ARN, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an existing Amazon S3 bucket. You can optionally include a subfolder. For example, to specify a subfolder named my-logs in a bucket named my-bucket, use the following ARN: arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/my-logs/ The bucket cannot use AWSLogs as a subfolder name, as this is a reserved term. If you own the bucket, we automatically create a resource policy and attach it to the bucket. For more information, see Amazon S3 bucket permissions for flow logs.
