If you enable private DNS for your interface VPC endpoint, and your VPC has both DNS hostnames and DNS resolution enabled, we create a hidden, AWS-managed private hosted zone for you. The hosted zone contains a record set for the default DNS name for the service that resolves it to the private IP addresses of the endpoint network interfaces in your VPC. Therefore, if you have existing applications that send requests to the AWS service using a public Regional endpoint, those requests now go through the endpoint network interfaces, without requiring that you make any changes to those applications.
