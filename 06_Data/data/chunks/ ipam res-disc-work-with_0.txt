A resource discovery is created by default when you create an IPAM. You can also create a resource discovery independently of an IPAM and integrate it with an IPAM owned by another account or organization. If the resource discovery owner is the delegated administrator of an organization, IPAM will monitor resources for all members of the organization.NoteCreating, sharing, and associating resource discoveries is part of the process of integrating IPAM with accounts outside of your organizations (see Integrate IPAM with accounts outside of your organization). If you are not creating an IPAM and integrating it with accounts outside your organization, you do not need to create, share, or associate resource discoveries.ContentsCreate a resource discovery
