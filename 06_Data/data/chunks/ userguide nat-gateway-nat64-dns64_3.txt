NAT64 enables your IPv6-only services in Amazon VPCs to communicate with IPv4-only services within the same VPC (in different subnets) or connected VPCs, in your on-premises networks, or over the internet.NAT64 is automatically available on your existing NAT gateways or on any new NAT gateways you create. It's not a feature you enable or disable.Once you have enabled DNS64 and your IPv6-only service sends network packets to the synthesized IPv6 address through the NAT gateway, the following happens:From the 64:ff9b::/96 prefix, the NAT gateway recognizes that the original destination is IPv4 and translates the IPv6 packets to IPv4 by replacing: Source IPv6 with its own private IP which is translated to Elastic IP address by the internet gateway. Destination IPv6 to IPv4 by truncating the 64:ff9b::/96 prefix.
