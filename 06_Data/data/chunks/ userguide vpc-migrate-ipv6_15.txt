To enable your instances to send and receive traffic over IPv6, you must update your security group rules to include rules for IPv6 addresses.For example, in the example above, you can update the web server security group (sg-11aa22bb11aa22bb1) to add rules that allow inbound HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH access from IPv6 addresses. You do not need to make any changes to the inbound rules for your database security group; the rule that allows all communication from sg-11aa22bb11aa22bb1 includes IPv6 communication by default.To update your security group rulesOpen the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.In the navigation pane, choose Security Groups and select your web server security group.In the Inbound Rules tab, choose Edit.
