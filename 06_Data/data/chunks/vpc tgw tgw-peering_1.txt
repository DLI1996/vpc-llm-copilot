After you create a peering attachment request, the owner of the peer transit gateway (also referred to as the accepter transit gateway) must accept the request. To route traffic between the transit gateways, add a static route to the transit gateway route table that points to the transit gateway peering attachment.We recommend using unique ASNs for each peered transit gateway to take advantage of future route propagation capabilities.Transit gateway peering does not support resolving public or private IPv4 DNS host names to private IPv4 addresses across VPCs on either side of the transit gateway peering attachment using the Amazon Route 53 Resolver in another Region. For more information about the Route 53 Resolver, see What is Route 53 Resolver? in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.
