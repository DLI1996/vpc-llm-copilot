Supports principal permissions YesWhen you use an IAM user or role to perform actions in AWS, you are considered a principal. Policies grant permissions to a principal. When you use some services, you might perform an action that then triggers another action in a different service. In this case, you must have permissions to perform both actions. To see whether an action requires additional dependent actions in a policy, see Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon EC2 in the Service Authorization Reference.Service roles for AWS PrivateLinkSupports service roles No
