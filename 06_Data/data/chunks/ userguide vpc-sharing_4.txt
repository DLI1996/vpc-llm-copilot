Use the create-resource-share and associate-resource-share commands.Map subnets across Availability ZonesTo ensure that resources are distributed across the Availability Zones for a Region, we independently map Availability Zones to names for each account. For example, the Availability Zone us-east-1a for your AWS account might not have the same location as us-east-1a for another AWS account.To coordinate Availability Zones across accounts for VPC sharing, you must use an AZ ID, which is a unique and consistent identifier for an Availability Zone. For example, use1-az1 is the AZ ID for one of the Availability Zones in the us-east-1 Region. Use AZ IDs to determine the location of resources in one account relative to another account. You can view the AZ ID for each subnet in the Amazon VPC console.
