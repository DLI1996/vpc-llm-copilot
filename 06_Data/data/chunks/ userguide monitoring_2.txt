You can use AWS CloudTrail to capture detailed information about the calls made to the Amazon VPC API. You can use the generated CloudTrail logs to determine which calls were made, the source IP address where the call came from, who made the call, when the call was made, and so on. For more information, see Logging Amazon EC2 Amazon EBS, and Amazon VPC API calls using AWS CloudTrail in the Amazon EC2 API Reference.Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
