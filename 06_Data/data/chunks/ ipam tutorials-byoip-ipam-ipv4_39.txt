View the EIP allocation is no longer managed in IPAM. It can take some time for IPAM to discover that the Elastic IP address has been removed. You cannot continue to clean up and deprovision the IPAM pool CIDR until you see that the allocation has been removed from IPAM. When you run the command in this section, the value for --region must match the --locale option you entered when you created the pool that will be used for the BYOIP CIDR. This step must be done by the IPAM account. aws ec2 get-ipam-pool-allocations --region us-west-2 --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0d8f3646b61ca5987 --profile ipam-account The output shows the allocation in IPAM. { "IpamPoolAllocations": []}
