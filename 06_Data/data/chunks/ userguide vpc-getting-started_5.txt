If your application will receive traffic from the internet, the VPC must have an internet gateway. Attaching an internet gateway to a VPC does not automatically make your instances accessible from the internet. In addition to attaching the internet gateway, you must update the subnet route table with a route to the internet gateway. You must also ensure that the instances have public IP addresses and an associated security group that allows traffic from the internet over specific ports and protocols required by your application.
