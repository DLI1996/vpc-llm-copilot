If there is no IPv6 address associated with the destination in the DNS record, the Route 53 Resolver synthesizes one by prepending the well-known /96 prefix, defined in RFC6052 (64:ff9b::/96), to the IPv4 address in the record. Your IPv6-only service sends network packets to the synthesized IPv6 address. You will then need to route this traffic through the NAT gateway, which performs the necessary translation on the traffic to allow IPv6 services in your subnet to access IPv4 services outside that subnet.You can enable or disable DNS64 on a subnet using the modify-subnet-attribute using the AWS CLI or with the VPC console by selecting a subnet and choosing Actions > Edit subnet settings.What is NAT64?
