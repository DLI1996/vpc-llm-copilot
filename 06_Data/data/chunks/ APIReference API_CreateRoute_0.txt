AWSDocumentationAmazon EC2API ReferenceRequest ParametersResponse ElementsErrorsExamplesSee AlsoCreateRouteCreates a route in a route table within a VPC.You must specify either a destination CIDR block or a prefix list ID. You must also specify exactly one of the resources from the parameter list.When determining how to route traffic, we use the route with the most specific match. For example, traffic is destined for the IPv4 address 192.0.2.3, and the route table includes the following two IPv4 routes:192.0.2.0/24 (goes to some target A)192.0.2.0/28 (goes to some target B)Both routes apply to the traffic destined for 192.0.2.3. However, the second route in the list covers a smaller number of IP addresses and is therefore more specific, so we use that route to determine where to target the traffic.For more information about route tables, see Route tables in the Amazon VPC User Guide.Request Parameters
