When you create a VPC, you must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the VPC. The allowed block size is between a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses) and /28 netmask (16 IP addresses). After you've created your VPC, you can associate additional IPv4 CIDR blocks with the VPC. For more information, see Add an IPv4 CIDR block to your VPC.When you create a VPC, we recommend that you specify a CIDR block from the private IPv4 address ranges as specified in RFC 1918.10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix) 10.0.0.0/16 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix) 172.31.0.0/16 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix) 192.168.0.0/20Important
