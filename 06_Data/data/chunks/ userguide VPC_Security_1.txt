Flow logs: Flow logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. You can create a flow log for a VPC, subnet, or individual network interface. Flow log data is published to CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3, and it can help you diagnose overly restrictive or overly permissive security group and network ACL rules. For more information, see Logging IP traffic using VPC Flow Logs.Traffic mirroring: You can copy network traffic from an elastic network interface of an Amazon EC2 instance. You can then send the traffic to out-of-band security and monitoring appliances. For more information, see the Traffic Mirroring Guide.Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
