AWS Cloud WAN supports Tunnel-less Connect for VPC Connect attachments. Tunnel-less Connect provides a simpler way to build a global SD-WAN using AWS. Third-party SD-WAN appliances can peer with Cloud WAN using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) without needing to deploy IPsec or GRE-based tunnels between the appliance and Cloud WAN. This allows you to deploy a Cloud WAN core network across multiple AWS Regions and to connect one or more of your third-party SD-WAN appliances to core network edges in each Region. Because Tunnel-less Connect has no tunneling overhead, it provides better performance and peak bandwidth on TLC attachments. IPSec provides 1.25G, allowing you to combine up to eight tunnels while providing up to the entire VPC attachment bandwidth. GRE supports only 5G, which means you'd need to deploy specialized techniques, such as ECMP (Equal Cost Multi-pathing),
