The following policy allows roles to manage security groups. The first statement allows roles to delete any security group with the tag Stack=test and to manage the inbound and outbound rules for any security group with the tag Stack=test. The second statement requires roles to tag any security groups that they create with the tag Stack=Test. The third statement allows roles to create tags when creating a security group. The fourth statement allows roles to view any security group and security group rule. The fifth statement allows roles to create a security group in a VPC.NoteThis policy cannot be used by the AWS CloudFormation service to create a security group with required tags. If you remove the condition on the ec2:CreateSecurityGroup action that requires the tag, the policy will work.{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [
