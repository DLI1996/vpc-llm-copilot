If you need public IPv4 DNS hostnames for the EC2 instances launched into your subnets, you must enable both of the DNS options. For more information, see DNS attributes for your VPC. Enable DNS hostnames: EC2 instances launched in the VPC receive public DNS hostnames that correspond to their public IPv4 addresses.Enable DNS resolution: DNS resolution for private DNS hostnames is provided for the VPC by the Amazon DNS server, called the Route 53 Resolver.Internet gatewayConnects your VPC to the internet. The instances in a public subnet can access the internet because the subnet route table contains a route that sends traffic bound for the internet to the internet gateway. If a server doesn't need to be directly reachable from the internet, you should not deploy it into a public subnet. For more information, see Internet gateways.Name
