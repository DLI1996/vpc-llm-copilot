If a subnet is associated with a route table that has a route to an internet gateway, it's known as a public subnet. If a subnet is associated with a route table that does not have a route to an internet gateway, it's known as a private subnet.In your public subnet's route table, you can specify a route for the internet gateway to all destinations not explicitly known to the route table (0.0.0.0/0 for IPv4 or ::/0 for IPv6). Alternatively, you can scope the route to a narrower range of IP addresses; for example, the public IPv4 addresses of your companyâ€™s public endpoints outside of AWS, or the Elastic IP addresses of other Amazon EC2 instances outside your VPC.IP addresses and NAT
