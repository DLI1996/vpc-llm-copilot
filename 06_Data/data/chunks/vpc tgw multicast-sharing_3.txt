Sharing across Availability ZonesTo ensure that resources are distributed across the Availability Zones for a Region, we independently map Availability Zones to names for each account. This could lead to Availability Zone naming differences across accounts. For example, the Availability Zone us-east-1a for your AWS account might not have the same location as us-east-1a for another AWS account.To identify the location of your multicast domain relative to your accounts, you must use the Availability Zone ID (AZ ID). The AZ ID is a unique and consistent identifier for an Availability Zone across all AWS accounts. For example, use1-az1 is an AZ ID for the us-east-1 Region and it is the same location in every AWS account.To view the AZ IDs for the Availability Zones in your accountOpen the AWS RAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ram.The AZ IDs for the current Region are displayed in the Your AZ ID panel on the right-hand side of the screen.
