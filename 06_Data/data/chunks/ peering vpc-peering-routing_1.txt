Similarly, if the VPCs in the VPC peering connection have associated IPv6 CIDR blocks, you can add routes that enable communication with the peer VPC over IPv6.For more information about supported route table configurations for VPC peering connections, see VPC peering configurations.ConsiderationsIf you have a VPC peered with multiple VPCs that have overlapping or matching IPv4 CIDR blocks, ensure that your route tables are configured to avoid sending response traffic from your VPC to the incorrect VPC. AWS currently does not support unicast reverse path forwarding in VPC peering connections that checks the source IP of packets and routes reply packets back to the source. For more information, see Routing for response traffic.
