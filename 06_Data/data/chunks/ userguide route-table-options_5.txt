Subnets that are in VPCs associated with AWS Outposts can have an additional target type of a local gateway. Consider the case where you want to have the local gateway route traffic with a destination address of 192.168.10.0/24 to the customer network. To do this, add the following route with the destination network and a target of the local gateway (lgw-xxxx).192.168.10.0/24 lgw-idEnable traffic between subnets in the same VPC across OutpostsYou can establish communication between subnets that are in the same VPC across different Outposts using Outpost local gateways and your on-premise network.You can use this feature to build architectures similar to multi-Availability Zone (AZ) architectures for your on-premise applications running on Outposts racks by establishing connectivity between Outposts racks that are anchored to different AZs.
