When you create the IPAM, you choose the AWS Regions where the IPAM is allowed to manage IP address CIDRs. These AWS Regions are called operating Regions. IPAM discovers and monitors resources only in the AWS Regions that you select as operating Regions. IPAM doesn't store any data outside of the operating Regions that you select.The following example hierarchy shows how the AWS Regions that you assign when you create the IPAM will impact the Regions that will be available for pools that you create later.
