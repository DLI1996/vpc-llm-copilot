The peer IP address (GRE outer IP address) on the transit gateway side of the Connect peer. The IP address must be specified from the transit gateway CIDR block, and must be unique across Connect attachments on the transit gateway. If you don't specify an IP address, we use the first available address from the transit gateway CIDR block. You can add a transit gateway CIDR block when you create or modify a transit gateway. The IP address can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address, but it must be the same IP address family as the peer IP address.The peer IP address and transit gateway address are used to uniquely identify the GRE tunnel. You can reuse either address across multiple tunnels, but not both in the same tunnel.
