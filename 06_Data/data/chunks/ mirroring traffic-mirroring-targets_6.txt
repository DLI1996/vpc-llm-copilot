The maximum MTU supported by the Gateway Load Balancer is 8500. Traffic Mirroring adds 54 bytes of additional headers to the original packet payload when using IPv4, and 74 bytes when using IPv6. Therefore, the maximum packet size that can be delivered to an appliance without truncation is 8500 – 54 = 8446 when using IPv4, or 8500 – 74 = 8426 when using IPv6.You can use the BytesProcessed and PacketsDropped CloudWatch metrics for VPC endpoints to monitor the volume of traffic being sent over the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint. You can also use CloudWatch metrics for Traffic Mirroring. For more information, see Monitor mirrored traffic using Amazon CloudWatch.VXLAN encapsulation
