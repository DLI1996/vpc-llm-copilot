(Optional) For BGP Inside CIDR blocks IPv6, enter the range of inside IPv6 addresses used for BGP peering. Use a /125 CIDR block from the fd00::/8 range.For Peer ASN, specify the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the appliance. You can use an existing ASN that's assigned to your network. If you do not have one, you can use any ASN in the 1-4294967294 range. The default is the same ASN as the core network edge. If you configure the Peer ASN to be different than the core network edge ASN (eBGP), you must configure ebgp-multihop with a time-to-live (TTL) value of 2.
