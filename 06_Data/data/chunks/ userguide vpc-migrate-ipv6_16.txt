For each rule, choose Add another rule, and choose Save when you're done. For example, to add a rule that allows all HTTP traffic over IPv6, for Type, select HTTP and for Source, enter ::/0.By default, an outbound rule that allows all IPv6 traffic is automatically added to your security groups when you associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC. However, if you modified the original outbound rules for your security group, this rule is not automatically added, and you must add equivalent outbound rules for IPv6 traffic.
