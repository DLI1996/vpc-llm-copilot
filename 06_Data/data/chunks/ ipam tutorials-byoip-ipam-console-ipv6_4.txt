Under Locale, choose None. You will set the locale on the Regional pool. The locale is the AWS Region where you want this IPAM pool to be available for allocations. For example, you can only allocate a CIDR for a VPC from an IPAM pool that shares a locale with the VPCâ€™s Region. Note that when you have chosen a locale for a pool, you cannot modify it. If the home Region of the IPAM is unavailable due to an outage and the pool has a locale different than the home Region of the IPAM, the pool can still be used to allocate IP addresses. NoteIf you are creating a single pool only and not a top-level pool with Regional pools within it, you would want to choose a Locale for this pool so that the pool is available for allocations.Under Public IP source, BYOIP is selected by default.
