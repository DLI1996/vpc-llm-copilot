If you've configured a middlebox appliance in your VPC, you can indicate the location of the appliance in the route analysis. This enables you to specify multiple network hops in a route between a source and destination, to help you analyze the route of the traffic. We store this information for use in future analyses. You can update your middlebox appliances later on as needed.You can also analyze the return path for traffic from the specified destination back to the source.The following rules apply when using the Route Analyzer:The Route Analyzer analyzes routes in transit gateway route tables only. It does not analyze routes in VPC route tables or in your customer gateway devices.The transit gateways must be registered in your global network.
