You create one or more rules which specify the domain names of the DNS queries that you want Route 53 Resolver to forward to your on-premises resolvers. You also specify the IPv4 addresses of the on-premises resolvers.Now that you have set up a Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoint, you need to enable DNS64 on the subnet containing your IPv6-only workloads and route any data destined for your on-premises network through a NAT gateway.How DNS64 works for IPv4-only destinations in on-premises networks:You assign an IPv4 address to the Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoint in your VPC.The DNS query from your IPv6 service goes to Route 53 Resolver over IPv6. Route 53 Resolver matches the query against the forwarding rule and gets an IPv4 address for your on-premises resolver.
