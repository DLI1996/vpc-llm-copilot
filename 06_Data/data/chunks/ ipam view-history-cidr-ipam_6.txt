Sampled start time: Sampled start time of the resource-to-CIDR association within the IPAM scope. Changes are picked up in periodic snapshots, so the start time might have occurred before this specific time. To help explain the times that you see under Sampled start time and Sampled end time, let’s look at an example use case:At 2:00 PM, a VPC was created with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16. At 3:00 PM, you create an IPAM and IPAM pool with CIDR 10.0.0.0/8, and select the auto-import option to allow IPAM to discover and import any CIDRs that fall within the 10.0.0.0/8 IP address range. Because IPAM picks up changes to CIDRs in periodic snapshots, it doesn’t discover the existing VPC CIDR until 3:05 PM. When you search for the ID of this VPC using the Search IP history feature, the Sampled start time for your
