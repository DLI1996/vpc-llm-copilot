In this example, a client in VPC A connects to a web server in VPC B through a transit gateway. The client and server are in different Availability Zones. Traffic arrives at the server in VPC B using one elastic network interface ID (in this example, let's say the ID is eni-11111111111111111) and leaves VPC B using another (for example eni-22222222222222222).You create a custom flow log for VPC B with the following format.The following lines from the flow log records demonstrate the flow of traffic on the network interface for the web server. The first line is the request traffic from the client, and the last line is the response traffic from the web server.
