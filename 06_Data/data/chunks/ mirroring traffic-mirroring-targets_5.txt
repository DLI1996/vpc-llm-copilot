To improve availability and fault tolerance, we recommend that you select at least two Availability Zones when you create the Gateway Load Balancer, and that you register target appliances in each selected Availability Zone.If all registered target appliances in an Availability Zone become unhealthy and cross-zone load balancing is disabled, the load balancer can't send the mirrored traffic to target appliances in another Availability Zone. If you enable cross-zone load balancing, the load balancer can send the mirrored traffic to healthy target appliances in another Availability Zone.
