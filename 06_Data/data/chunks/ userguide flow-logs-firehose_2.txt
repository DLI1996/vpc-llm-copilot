In the source account, create a role that grants the following permissions. In this example, the name of the role is mySourceRole, but you can choose a different name for this role. The last statement allows the role in the destination account to assume this role. The condition statements ensure that this role is passed only to the log delivery service, and only when monitoring the specified resource. When you create your policy, specify the VPCs, network interfaces, or subnets that you're monitoring with the condition key iam:AssociatedResourceARN.{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [{ "Effect": "Allow", "Action": "iam:PassRole", "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::{ "StringEquals":{ "iam:PassedToService": "delivery.logs.amazonaws.com" }, "StringLike":
