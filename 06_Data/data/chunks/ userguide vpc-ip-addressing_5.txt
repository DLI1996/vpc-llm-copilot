Private IPv4 addressesPrivate IPv4 addresses (also referred to as private IP addresses in this topic) are not reachable over the internet, and can be used for communication between the instances in your VPC. When you launch an instance into a VPC, a primary private IP address from the IPv4 address range of the subnet is assigned to the default network interface (eth0) of the instance. Each instance is also given a private (internal) DNS hostname that resolves to the private IP address of the instance. The hostname can be of two types: resource-based or IP-based. For more information, see EC2 instance naming. If you don't specify a primary private IP address, we select an available IP address in the subnet range for you. For more information about network interfaces, see Elastic Network Interfaces in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
