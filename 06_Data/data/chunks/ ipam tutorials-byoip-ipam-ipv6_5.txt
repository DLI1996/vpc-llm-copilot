{ "RegionName": "us-west-2" } ], "Tags": [] } }Step 3: Create an IPAM poolSince you are going to create a top-level IPAM pool with a Regional pool within it, and we’re going to allocate space to a resource (a VPC) from the Regional pool, you will set the locale on the Regional pool and not the top-level pool. You’ll add the locale to the Regional pool when you create the Regional pool in a later step. The IPAM integration with BYOIP requires that the locale is set on whichever pool will be used for the BYOIP CIDR.This step must be done by the IPAM account.
