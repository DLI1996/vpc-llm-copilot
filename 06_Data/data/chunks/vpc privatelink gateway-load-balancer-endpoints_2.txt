Before you can use the endpoint service the service provider must accept the connection requests. The service can't initiate requests to resources in your VPC through the VPC endpoint. The endpoint only returns responses to traffic that was initiated by resources in your VPC.Each Gateway Load Balancer endpoint can support a bandwidth of up to 10 Gbps per Availability Zone and automatically scales up to 100 Gbps.If an endpoint service is associated with multiple Gateway Load Balancers, a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint establishes a connection with only one load balancer per Availability Zone.To keep traffic within the same Availability Zone, we recommend that you create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint in each Availability Zone to which you'll send traffic.
