For third-party appliances in a different subnets from the Cloud WAN VPC attachment:If the third-party appliance is in a different subnet from the VPC attachment, you can still establish dynamic route exchange the core network edge using BGP. However, in addition to adding the core network BGP addresses for peering, you must modify the VPC route table for the dataplane to function correctly. This includes adding the prefixes received from the core network edge BGP peer into the route table. You can create a summary route that encompasses the longest prefixes advertised by the core network edge.The BGP IPv4 prefixes advertised by the core network edge to your third-party appliance will have the core network BGP address as the next-hop.
