Under Source type, choose IPAM pool. Then, under Source pool, choose the IPv6 Regional pool. (Optional) Choose a CIDR to provision for the pool. You can only provision a CIDR that was provisioned to the top-level pool. You can create a pool without a CIDR, but you won’t be able to use the pool for allocations until you’ve provisioned a CIDR for it. You can add CIDRs to a pool at any time by editing the pool. You have the same allocation rule options here as you did when you created the IPv6 Regional pool. See Create a Regional IPv6 pool for an explanation of the options
