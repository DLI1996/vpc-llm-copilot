You cannot associate a security group with an egress-only internet gateway. You can use security groups for your instances in the private subnet to control the traffic to and from those instances.You can use a network ACL to control the traffic to and from the subnet for which the egress-only internet gateway routes traffic.In the following diagram, the VPC has both IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks, and the subnet both IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks. The VPC has an egress-only internet gateway.The following is an example of the route table associated with the subnet. There is a route that sends all internet-bound IPv6 traffic (::/0) to the egress-only internet gateway.10.0.0.0/16 Local 2001:db8:1234:1a00:/64 Local ::/0 eigw-id
