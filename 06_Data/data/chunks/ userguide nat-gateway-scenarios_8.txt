Launch an instance in your private subnet. In the launch wizard, ensure that you select an Amazon Linux AMI. Do not assign a public IP address to your instance. Ensure that your security group rules allow inbound SSH traffic from the private IP address of your instance that you launched in the public subnet, and all outbound ICMP traffic. You must choose the same key pair that you used to launch your instance in the public subnet.Configure SSH agent forwarding on your local computer, and connect to your bastion host in the public subnet. For more information, see To configure SSH agent forwarding for Linux or macOS or To configure SSH agent forwarding for Windows.
