If, in Step 5, you selected the service name for Amazon S3, and if you want to configure private DNS support, select Additional settings, Enable DNS name. When you make this selection, it also automatically selects Enable private DNS only for inbound endpoint. You can configure private DNS with an inbound Resolver endpoint only for interface endpoints for Amazon S3. If you do not have a gateway endpoint for Amazon S3 and you select Enable private DNS only for inbound endpoint, you'll receive an error when you attempt the final step in this procedure. If, in Step 5, you selected the service name for any service other than Amazon S3, Additional settings, Enable DNS name is already selected. We recommend that you keep the default.
