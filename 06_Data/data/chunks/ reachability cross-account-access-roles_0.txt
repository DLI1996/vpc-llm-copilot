This role allows the management account and delegated administrator accounts to specify resources from member accounts in path analyses.Reachability Analyzer creates the custom IAM role automatically when you turn on trusted access using the Network Manager console. We strongly recommend that you use the console to turn on trusted access, as alternate approaches require an advanced level of expertise and are more prone to error.
