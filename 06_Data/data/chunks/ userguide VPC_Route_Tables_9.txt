You can't add routes to IPv6 addresses that are an exact match or a subset of the following range: fd00:ec2::/32. This range is within the unique local address (ULA) space and is reserved for use by AWS services. For example, Amazon EC2 uses addresses in this range for services that are accessible only from EC2 instances, such as the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) and the Amazon DNS server. You can use a CIDR block that is larger than but overlaps fd00:ec2::/32, but packets destined for addresses in fd00:ec2::/32 will not be forwarded.You can add middlebox appliances to the routing paths for your VPC. For more information, see Routing for a middlebox appliance.Example
