(Optional) For Condition logic, further refine how the attachment is associated with the segment: Choose OR — if you want to associate the attachment with the segment by either the Segment name/Attachment tag value, or by the chosen conditions. Choose AND — if you want to associate the attachment with the segment by either the Segment name/Attachment tag value and by the chosen conditions. If no acceptance option is chosen, attachments are automatically mapped to the segment.
