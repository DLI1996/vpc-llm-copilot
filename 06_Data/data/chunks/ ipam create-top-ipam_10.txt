After you create an IPAM, when you create a VPC, choose the IPAM-allocated CIDR block option. If you do not, the CIDR you choose for your VPC may overlap with an IPAM CIDR allocation. If you have a VPC already allocated in an IPAM pool, a VPC with an overlapping CIDR cannot be automatically imported. For example, if you have a VPC with a 10.0.0.0/26 CIDR allocated in an IPAM pool, a VPC with a 10.0.0.0/23 CIDR (that would cover the 10.0.0.0/26 CIDR) cannot be imported.
