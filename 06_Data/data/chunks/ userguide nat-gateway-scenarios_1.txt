The following diagram illustrates this use case. There are two Availability Zones, with two subnets in each Availability Zone. The route table for each subnet determines how traffic is routed. In Availability Zone A, the instances in the public subnet can reach the internet through a route to the internet gateway, while the instances in the private subnet have no route to the internet. In Availability Zone B, the public subnet contains a NAT gateway, and the instances in the private subnet can reach the internet through a route to the NAT gateway in the public subnet. Both private and public NAT gateways map the source private IPv4 address of the instances to the private IPv4 address of the private NAT gateway, but in the case of a public NAT gateway, the internet gateway then maps the private IPv4 address of the public
