If you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, you can associate an IPv6 CIDR block with a subnet when you create it. The allowed block size for an IPv6 subnet is a /64 netmask.If you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they're set up in a star topology with a logical router in the middle.When you stop an instance in a subnet, it retains its private IPv4 address. It's therefore possible to have a subnet with no running instances (they're all stopped), but no remaining IP addresses available.For more information, see Subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide.Request ParametersThe following parameters are for this specific action.
