AWSDocumentationAmazon VPCUser GuideDefault security groups for your VPCsYour default VPCs and any VPCs that you create come with a default security group. The name of the default security group is "default".We recommend that you create security groups for specific resources or groups of resources instead of using the default security group. However, if you don't associate a security group with some resources at creation time, we associate them with the default security group. For example, if you don't specify a security group when you launch an EC2 instance, we associate the instance with the default security group for its VPC.Default security group basicsYou can change the rules for a default security group.You can't delete a default security group.
