The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) across the VPC peering connection over Regions is 1500 bytes. Jumbo frames (MTUs up to 9001 bytes) are not supported for inter-Region VPC peering connections.

For more information about jumbo frames, see Jumbo frames (9001 MTU) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.You must enable DNS resolution support for the VPC peering connection to resolve private DNS hostnames of the peered VPC to private IP addresses, even if the IPv4 CIDR for the VPC falls into the private IPv4 address ranges specified by RFC 1918.Shared VPCs and subnets
