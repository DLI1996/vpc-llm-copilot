Associate the same VPC route table with all of the subnets that are associated with the transit gateway, unless your network design requires multiple VPC route tables (for example, a middle-box VPC that routes traffic through multiple NAT gateways).Use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Site-to-Site VPN connections. If your customer gateway device or firewall for the connection supports multipath, enable the feature.Enable route propagation for AWS Direct Connect gateway attachments and BGP Site-to-Site VPN attachments.When migrating from VPC peering to use a transit gateway, consider the following: A transit gateway does not support security group referencing. An MTU size mismatch between VPC peering and the transit gateway might result in some packets dropping for asymmetric traffic. Update both VPCs at the same time to avoid jumbo packets dropping due to size mismatches.
