The Local Zone subnets follow the same routing rules as Availability Zone subnets, including route tables, security groups, and network ACLs.Outbound internet traffic leaves a Local Zone from the Local Zone.You must provision public IP addresses for use in a Local Zone. When you allocate addresses, you can specify the location from which the IP address is advertised. We refer to this as a network border group, and you can set this parameter to limit the addresses to this location. After you provision the IP addresses, you cannot move them between the Local Zone and the parent Region (for example, from us-west-2-lax-1a to us-west-2).If the Local Zone supports IPv6, you can request IPv6 Amazon-provided IP addresses and associate them with the network border group for a new or existing VPC. For the list of Local Zones that support IPv6, see Considerations in the AWS Local Zones User Guide
