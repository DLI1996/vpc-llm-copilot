When a static route and a propagated route have the same destination, the static route has the higher priority, so the propagated route is not included in the route table. If you remove the static route, the overlapping propagated route is included in the route table.Routes for peering attachmentsYou can peer two transit gateways, and route traffic between them. To do this, you create a peering attachment on your transit gateway, and specify the peer transit gateway with which to create the peering connection. You then create a static route in your transit gateway route table to route traffic to the transit gateway peering attachment. Traffic that's routed to the peer transit gateway can then be routed to the VPC and VPN attachments for the peer transit gateway.For more information, see Example: Peered transit gateways.Route evaluation order
