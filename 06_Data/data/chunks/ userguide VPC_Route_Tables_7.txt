You can add a route to your route tables that is more specific than the local route. The destination must match the entire IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR block of a subnet in your VPC. The target must be a NAT gateway, network interface, or Gateway Load Balancer endpoint.If your route table has multiple routes, we use the most specific route that matches the traffic (longest prefix match) to determine how to route the traffic.
