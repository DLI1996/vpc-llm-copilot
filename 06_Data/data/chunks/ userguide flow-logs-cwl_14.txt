Modify the filter as needed by specifying values for the fields. The following examples filter by specific source IP addresses. [version, accountid, interfaceid, srcaddr = 10.0.0.1, dstaddr, srcport, dstport, protocol, packets, bytes, start, end, action, logstatus][version, accountid, interfaceid, srcaddr = 10.0.2.*, dstaddr, srcport, dstport, protocol, packets, bytes, start, end, action, logstatus] The following examples filter by destination port, the number of bytes, and whether the traffic was rejected. [version, accountid, interfaceid, srcaddr, dstaddr, srcport, dstport = 80 || dstport = 8080, protocol, packets, bytes, start, end, action, logstatus][version, accountid, interfaceid, srcaddr, dstaddr, srcport, dstport = 80 || dstport = 8080, protocol, packets, bytes >= 400, start, end, action = REJECT, logstatus]Process flow log records in CloudWatch Logs
