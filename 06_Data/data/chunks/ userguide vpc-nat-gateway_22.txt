ImportantWhen you assign a secondary EIP to a public NAT gateway, the network border group of the EIP must match the network border group of the Availability Zone (AZ) that the public NAT gateway is in. If it's not the same, the EIP will fail to assign. You can see the network border group for the subnet's AZ by viewing the details of the subnet. Similarly, you can view the network border group of an EIP by viewing the details of the EIP address. For more information about network border groups and EIPs, see Allocate an Elastic IP address. Your NAT gateway can have up to 8 IP addresses associated with it. If this is a public NAT gateway, there is a default quota limit for EIPs per Region. For more information, see Elastic IP addresses. If you chose to unassign or disassociate new IPv4 addresses, complete the following:
