Latency metrics represent round-trip traffic latency of synthetic traffic streams between selected sources and destinations. This is a combination of the latency of the underlying physical network and the latency between the host and the underlying physical network. The Infrastructure Performance dashboard also provides a network health status, indicating whether the aggregate network latency is normal or degraded. The health status is determined based on expected AWS network performance between AWS Regions and Availability Zones. The health status is available only for inter-Region and inter-Availability Zone metrics.NoteIn case of a degraded health status, AWS is automatically notified of the incident.Region availabilityInfrastructure Performance is available in the following AWS Regions:
