Subnet 2 (VPC B) VPC B CIDR Local Subnet in VPC A CIDR pcx-aaaabbbb VPC A VPC A CIDR Local VPC C CIDR pcx-aaaaccccSuppose that an instance in subnet 2 in VPC B sends traffic to the Active Directory server in VPC A using VPC peering connection pcx-aaaabbbb. VPC A sends the response traffic to Active Directory server. However, the VPC A route table is configured to send all traffic within the VPC CIDR range to VPC peering connection pcx-aaaacccc. If subnet 2 in VPC C has an instance with the same IP address as the instance in subnet two of VPC B, it receives the response traffic from VPC A. The instance in subnet 2 in VPC B does not receive a response to its request to VPC A.
