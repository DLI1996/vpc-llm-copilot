For demonstration purposes, under Tags, do not add any additional tags at this time. When you created the pre-prod pool (in 5. Create a pre-production development pool), you added an allocation rule that required any VPCs that are created with CIDRs from this pool to have an environment/pre-prod tag. Leave the environment/pre-prod tag off for now so that you can see that an error appears telling you that a required tag was not added.Choose Create VPC.An error appears telling you that a required tag was not added. The error appears because you set an allocation rule when you created the pre-prod pool (in Step 5: Create a pre-production development pool). The allocation rule required any VPCs that are created with CIDRs from this pool to have an environment/pre-prod tag.Now, under Tags, add the tag environment/pre-prod and choose Create VPC again.
