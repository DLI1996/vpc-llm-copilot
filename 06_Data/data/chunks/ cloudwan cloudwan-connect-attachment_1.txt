You can create a transit gateway Connect attachment to establish a connection between a core network edge and third-party virtual appliances (such as SD-WAN appliances) running in Amazon VPC. A Connect attachment supports both the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnel protocol and Tunnel-less connect protocol for high performance, and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for dynamic routing. After you create a Connect attachment, you can create one or more GRE or Tunnel-less Connect tunnels (also referred to as Transit Gateway Connect peers) on the Connect attachment to connect the core network edge and the third-party appliance. You establish two BGP sessions over the tunnel to exchange routing information. The two BGP sessions are for redundancy. A Connect attachment uses an existing VPC attachment as the underlying transport mechanism. This is referred to as the transport attachment.
