Your account has a quota on the number of entries you can add per route table. If the number of VPC peering connections in your VPC exceeds the route table entry quota for a single route table, consider using multiple subnets that are each associated with a custom route table.You can add a route for a VPC peering connection that's in the pending-acceptance state. However, the route has a state of blackhole, and has no effect until the VPC peering connection is in the active state.To add an IPv4 route for a VPC peering connectionOpen the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.In the navigation pane, choose Route tables.Select the check box next to the route table that's associated with the subnet in which your instance resides. If you do not have a route table explicitly associated with that subnet, the main route table for the VPC is implicitly associated with the subnet.
