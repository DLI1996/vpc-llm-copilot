A NAT gateway supports 5 Gbps of bandwidth and automatically scales up to 100 Gbps. If you require more bandwidth, you can split your resources into multiple subnets and create a NAT gateway in each subnet.A NAT gateway can process one million packets per second and automatically scales up to ten million packets per second. Beyond this limit, a NAT gateway will drop packets. To prevent packet loss, split your resources into multiple subnets and create a separate NAT gateway for each subnet.
