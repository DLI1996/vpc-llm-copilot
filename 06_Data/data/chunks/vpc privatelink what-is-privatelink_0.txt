You do not need to use an internet gateway, NAT device, public IP address, AWS Direct Connect connection, or AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to allow communication with the service from your private subnets. Therefore, you control the specific API endpoints, sites, and services that are reachable from your VPC.Use casesYou can create VPC endpoints to connect resources in your VPC to services that integrate with AWS PrivateLink. You can create your own VPC endpoint service and make it available to other AWS customers. For more information, see AWS PrivateLink concepts.
