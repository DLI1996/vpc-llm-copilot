In the following example, your on-premises network consists of two sites. The Chicago site has two devices and the New York site has one device. Your AWS network consists of two transit gateways. All devices are associated with customer gateways (Site-to-Site VPN attachments) on both transit gateways.Your on-premises network is managed using SD-WAN. The SD-WAN controller creates Site-to-Site VPN connections to the transit gateways, and creates the device, site, and link resources in Network Manager. This automates connectivity and enables you to get a full view of your network in global networks. The SD-WAN controller can also use global networks events and metrics to enhance its dashboard.For more information about Partners who can help you set up your Site-to-Site VPN connections, see AWS Network Manager.Connection between devices
