The following diagram shows the key components of the configuration for this scenario. First, your IP management team determines which address ranges can overlap (non-routable address ranges) and which cannot (routable address ranges). The IP management team allocates address ranges from the pool of routable address ranges to projects on request.Each VPC has its original IP address range, which is non-routable, plus the routable IP address range assigned to it by the IP management team. VPC A has a subnet from its routable range with a private NAT gateway. The private NAT gateway gets its IP address from its subnet. VPC B has a subnet from its routable range with an Application Load Balancer. The Application Load Balancer gets its IP addresses from its subnets.
