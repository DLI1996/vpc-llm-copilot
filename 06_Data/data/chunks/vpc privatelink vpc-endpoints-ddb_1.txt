If you're using the Amazon DNS servers, you must enable both DNS hostnames and DNS resolution for your VPC. If you're using your own DNS server, ensure that requests to DynamoDB resolve correctly to the IP addresses maintained by AWS.The outbound rules for the security group for instances that access DynamoDB through the gateway endpoint must allow traffic to DynamoDB. You can use the ID of the prefix list for DynamoDB as the destination in the outbound rule.DynamoDB does not support resource-based policies (for example, on tables). Access to DynamoDB is controlled through the endpoint policy and policies for individual users and roles.If you use AWS CloudTrail to log DynamoDB operations, the log files contain the private IP addresses of the EC2 instances in the service consumer VPC and the ID of the gateway endpoint for any requests performed through the endpoint.
