Network segmentation – Verify that your production environment VPCs and development environment VPCs are isolated from one another. Likewise, you can verify that a separate logical network is used for systems that process credit card information, and that it's isolated from the rest of your environment.Internet accessibility – Identify resources in your environment that can be accessed from internet gateways, and verify that they are limited to only those resources that have a legitimate need to be accessible from the internet.Trusted network paths – Verify that you have appropriate network controls such as network firewalls and NAT gateways on all network paths between your resources and internet gateways.
