Flow log limitationsTo use flow logs, you need to be aware of the following limitations:You can't enable flow logs for VPCs that are peered with your VPC unless the peer VPC is in your account.After you create a flow log, you cannot change its configuration or the flow log record format. For example, you can't associate a different IAM role with the flow log, or add or remove fields in the flow log record. Instead, you can delete the flow log and create a new one with the required configuration.If your network interface has multiple IPv4 addresses and traffic is sent to a secondary private IPv4 address, the flow log displays the primary private IPv4 address in the dstaddr field. To capture the original destination IP address, create a flow log with the pkt-dstaddr field.
