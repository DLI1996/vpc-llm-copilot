After it's registered, a delegated administrator has the same permissions as the management account. A delegated administrator for the Network Manager service can leverage the SLRs in the member accounts that were deployed when trusted access was enabled and can view transit gateways from other member accounts and can register them to your global network. This allows transit gateways and associated resources to appear in your global network topology. In addition AWS CloudFormation StackSets is updated to include the delegated administrator accounts in the trusted relationship of the deployed IAM roles in the member accounts.For information about registering a delegated administrator, see Register a delegated administrator.Deregister delegated administrators
