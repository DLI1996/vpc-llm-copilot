ExcludePaths â€“ Prevents certain network paths from appearing in your findings. Typically, you specify network paths that you consider to be a legitimate exception to your network security or compliance requirements. For example, to identify all network interfaces that are reachable from an internet gateway except for your web servers, specify the relevant paths using MatchPaths, and then exclude any path with your web servers as a destination using ExcludePaths. When you analyze this Network Access Scope, you would see any network paths that originate from an internet gateway and end at a network interface, except for any paths that end at your web servers.
