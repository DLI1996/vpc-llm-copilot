The following considerations apply to traffic that passes through a VPC endpoint:By default, each VPC endpoint can support a bandwidth of up to 10 Gbps per Availability Zone, and automatically scales up to 100 Gbps. The maximum bandwidth for a VPC endpoint, when distributing the load across all Availability Zones, is the number of Availability Zones multiplied by 100 Gbps. If your application needs higher throughput, contact AWS support.The maximum transmission unit (MTU) of a network connection is the size, in bytes, of the largest permissible packet that can be passed through a VPC endpoint. The larger the MTU, the more data that can be passed in a single packet. A VPC endpoint supports an MTU of 8500 bytes. Packets with a size larger than 8500 bytes that arrive at the VPC endpoint are dropped.
