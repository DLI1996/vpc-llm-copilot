Use security groups as the primary mechanism for controlling network access to your VPCs. When necessary, use network ACLs to provide stateless, coarse-grain network control. Security groups are more versatile than network ACLs, due to their ability to perform stateful packet filtering and create rules that reference other security groups. Network ACLs can be effective as a secondary control (for example, to deny a specific subset of traffic) or as high-level subnet guard rails. Also, because network ACLs apply to an entire subnet, they can be used as defense-in-depth in case an instance is ever launched without the correct security group.
