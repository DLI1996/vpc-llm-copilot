has been chosen to be exempt from monitoring. IPAM does not evaluate ignored resources for overlap or allocation rule compliance. When a resource is chosen to be ignored, any space allocated to it from an IPAM pool is returned to the pool and the resource will not be imported again through automatic import (if the automatic import allocation rule is set on the pool). -: This resource is not one of the types of resources that IPAM can manage.
