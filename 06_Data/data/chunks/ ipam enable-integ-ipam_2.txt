You must enable integration with AWS Organizations by using IPAM in the AWS management console or the enable-ipam-organization-admin-account AWS CLI command. This ensures that the AWSServiceRoleForIPAM service-linked role is created. If you enable trusted access with AWS Organizations by using the AWS Organizations console or the register-delegated-administrator AWS CLI command, the AWSServiceRoleForIPAM service-linked role isn't created, and you can't manage or monitor resources within your organization.NoteWhen integrating with AWS Organizations:IPAM charges you for each active IP address that it monitors in your organization's member accounts.
