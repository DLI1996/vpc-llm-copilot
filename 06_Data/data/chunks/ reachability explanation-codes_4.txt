Traffic between a Gateway Load Balancer and its targets must use the GENEVE protocol, which is UDP-based. To analyze connectivity through a Gateway Load Balancer, specify the UDP protocol in the path definition.HIGHER_PRIORITY_ROUTEThis route table contains a route to the destination that can't be used because there is a higher priority route with the same destination CIDR.IGW_DESTINATION_ADDRESS_IN_VPC_CIDRSInternet gateways accept traffic only if the destination address is within the VPC CIDR block.IGW_DESTINATION_ADDRESS_NOT_IN_RFC1918_EGRESSInternet gateways reject outbound traffic with destination addresses in the private IP address range (see RFC1918).IGW_DESTINATION_ADDRESS_NOT_IN_RFC6598_EGRESSInternet gateways reject outbound traffic with destination addresses in the shared IP address range (see RFC6598).IGW_NAT_REFLECTION
