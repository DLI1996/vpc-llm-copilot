AWSDocumentationAmazon VPCUser GuideSubnet sizing for IPv6Subnet CIDR blocksThe IP addresses for your subnets are represented using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. The CIDR block of a subnet can be the same as the CIDR block for the VPC (to create a single subnet in the VPC), or a subset of the CIDR block for the VPC (to create multiple subnets in the VPC). The allowed block size is between a /28 netmask and /16 netmask. If you create more than one subnet in a VPC, the CIDR blocks of the subnets cannot overlap.There are tools available on the internet to help you calculate and create IPv4 subnet CIDR blocks. You can find tools that suit your needs by searching for terms such as 'subnet calculator' or 'CIDR calculator'. Your network engineering group can also help you determine the IPv4 CIDR blocks to specify for your subnets.
