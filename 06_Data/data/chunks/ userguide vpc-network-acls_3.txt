A network ACL has inbound rules and outbound rules. Each rule can either allow or deny traffic. Each rule has a number from 1 to 32766. We evaluate the rules in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule, when deciding whether allow or deny traffic. If the traffic matches a rule, the rule is applied and we do not evaluate any additional rules. We recommend that you start by creating rules in increments (for example, increments of 10 or 100) so that you can insert new rules later on, if needed.We evaluate the network ACL rules when traffic enters and leaves the subnet, not as it is routed within a subnet.
