Release the last IP address in the CIDR from the public IPv4 pool. Enter the IP address with a netmask of /32. You must rerun this command for each IP address in the CIDR range. If your CIDR is a /24, you will have to run this command to deprovision each of the 256 IP addresses in the /24 CIDR. When you run the command in this section, the value for --region must match the Region of your IPAM. This step must be done by the byoip-owner-account account. aws ec2 deprovision-public-ipv4-pool-cidr --region us-east-1 --profile byoip-owner-account --pool-id ipv4pool-ec2-0019eed22a684e0b3 --cidr 130.137.249.255/32 In the output, you'll see the deprovisioned CIDR. { "PoolId": "ipv4pool-ec2-0019eed22a684e0b3",
