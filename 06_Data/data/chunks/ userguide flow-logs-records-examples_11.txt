You create another custom flow log using the same set of fields as above. You create the flow log for the network interface for the instance in the private subnet. In this case, the instance-id field returns the ID of the instance that's associated with the network interface, and there is no difference between the dstaddr and pkt-dstaddr fields and the srcaddr and pkt-srcaddr fields. Unlike the network interface for the NAT gateway, this network interface is not an intermediate network interface for traffic.
