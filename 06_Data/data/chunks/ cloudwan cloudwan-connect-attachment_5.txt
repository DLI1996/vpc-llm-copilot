The appliance must be deployed in a VPC and use a Connect attachment enabled for the tunnel-less operation in order to connect your SD-WAN appliance to a core network edge.Attachment policy tags or resource names are used to associate the Tunnel-less Connect attachment to the SD-WAN segment.Both Connect (GRE) and Connect (Tunnel-less) attachments can co-exist in the same VPC. There is a maximum of single Connect (Tunnel-less) attachment per VPC.Tunnel-less Connect and any underlying transport VPC attachments must be associated to the same core network segment.Routing
