When you delegate an IPAM admin, a service-linked role is automatically created in each of your AWS Organizations member accounts. IPAM monitors the IP address usage in these accounts by assuming the service-linked role in each member account. It can then discover the resources and their CIDRs regardless of their Organizational Unit.You cannot complete this step unless you have the required AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions.
