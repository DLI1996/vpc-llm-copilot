your core network policy. With a policy, you can make any changes or additions to your core network and apply those changes through an updated JSON policy. You can do this using either the visual editor on the console, or through an included JSON editor. You can maintain multiple versions of a policy, although only one policy can be in effect. At any time, you can update your core network to use a new policy or revert to a previous version.
