A hosted zone is a container for DNS records that define how to route traffic for a domain or subdomain. With a public hosted zone, the records specify how to route traffic on the internet. With a private hosted zone, the records specify how to route traffic in your VPCs.You can configure Amazon Route 53 to route domain traffic to a VPC endpoint. For more information, see Routing traffic to a VPC endpoint using your domain name.You can use Route 53 to configure split-horizon DNS, where you use the same domain name for both a public website and an endpoint service powered by AWS PrivateLink. DNS requests for the public hostname from the consumer VPC resolve to the private IP addresses of the endpoint network interfaces, but requests from outside the VPC continue to resolve to the public endpoints. For more information, see DNS Mechanisms for Routing Traffic and Enabling Failover for AWS PrivateLink Deployments.
