Regions â€” Generate network performance metrics to see performance between two Regions. You can use the Region metrics to evaluate a Region expansion strategy. Infrastructure Performance can help you gather information needed to understand network performance between Regions where you currently have a presence, and Regions that you're exploring expanding into. For example, you might have a presence in us-west-2 and are looking to expand into eu-central-1. Use Infrastructure Performance to check the latency between these two Regions to help you make a more informed choice for Region expansion. For a list of the Regions that support Infrastructure Performance, see Region availability.NoteInfrastructure Performance does not incorporate performance metrics for paths through VPC networking resources, such as transit gateways, NAT gateways, VPC endpoints, Elastic Load Balancing, or Amazon EC2 network interfaces.
