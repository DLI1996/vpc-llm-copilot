You can apply tags to your flow logs. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tags can help you organize your flow logs, for example by purpose or owner.If you no longer require a flow log, you can delete it. Deleting a flow log disables the flow log service for the resource, and no new flow log records are created or published to CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3. Deleting the flow log does not delete any existing flow log records or log streams (for CloudWatch Logs) or log file objects (for Amazon S3) for a transit gateway. To delete an existing log stream, use the CloudWatch Logs console. To delete existing log file objects, use the Amazon S3 console. After you've deleted a flow log, it can take several minutes to stop collecting data.
