In this configuration, there is a central VPC with two subnets (VPC A), a peering connection between VPC A and VPC B (pcx-aaaabbbb), and a peering connection between VPC A and VPC C (pcx-aaaacccc). Each VPC requires access to the resources in only one of the subnets in VPC A.The route table for subnet 1 uses VPC peering connection pcx-aaaabbbb to access the entire CIDR block of VPC B. The route table for VPC B uses pcx-aaaabbbb to access the CIDR block of subnet 1 in VPC A. The route table for subnet 2 uses VPC peering connection pcx-aaaacccc to access the entire CIDR block of VPC C. The route table for VPC C table uses pcx-aaaacccc to access the CIDR block of subnet 2 in VPC A.
