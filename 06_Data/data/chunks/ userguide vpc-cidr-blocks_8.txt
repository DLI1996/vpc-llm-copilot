If you're using AWS Direct Connect to connect to multiple VPCs through a Direct Connect gateway, the VPCs that are associated with the Direct Connect gateway must not have overlapping CIDR blocks. If you add a CIDR block to one of the VPCs that's associated with the Direct Connect gateway, ensure that the new CIDR block does not overlap with an existing CIDR block of any other associated VPC. For more information, see Direct Connect gateways in the AWS Direct Connect User Guide.When you add or remove a CIDR block, it can go through various states: associating | associated | disassociating | disassociated | failing | failed. The CIDR block is ready for you to use when it's in the associated state.
