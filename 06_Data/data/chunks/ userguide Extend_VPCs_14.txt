You can't create a transit gateway attachment to a subnet in a Wavelength Zone. Instead, create the attachment through a subnet in the parent Availability Zone, and then route traffic to the desired destinations through the transit gateway. For an example, see the next section.Considerations for multiple Wavelength ZonesEC2 instances that are in different Wavelength Zones in the same VPC are not allowed to communicate with each other. If you need Wavelength Zone to Wavelength Zone communication, AWS recommends that you use multiple VPCs, one for each Wavelength Zone. You can use a transit gateway to connect the VPCs. This configuration enables communication between instances in the Wavelength Zones.Wavelength Zone to Wavelength Zone traffic routes through the AWS Region.
