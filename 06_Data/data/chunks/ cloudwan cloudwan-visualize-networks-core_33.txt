You can monitor your core network using CloudWatch Events, which delivers a near-real-time stream of system events that describe changes in your resources. Using simple rules that you can quickly set up, you can match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams. For more information about CloudWatch Events, see the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide.Prerequisites: Before monitoring CloudWatch Events you must first onboard CloudWatch Logs Insights. This is a one-time process that needs to be completed at the account level. After this is set up for your core network, you'll be able to see event updates on this page.
