You can use any of the following options for the Elastic IP addresses: Have Amazon provide the Elastic IP addresses. When you select this option, you can associate the Elastic IP addresses with a network border group. This is the location from which we advertise the CIDR block. Setting the network border group limits the CIDR block to this group. Use your own IP addresses. For information about bringing your own IP addresses, see Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.
