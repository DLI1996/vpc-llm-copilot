When migrating from VPC peering to use a transit gateway, an MTU size mismatch between VPC peering and the transit gateway might result in some asymmetric traffic packets dropping. Update both VPCs at the same time to avoid jumbo packets dropping due to a size mismatch.Packets with a size larger than 8500 bytes that arrive at the transit gateway are dropped.The transit gateway does not generate the FRAG_NEEDED for ICMPv4 packet, or the Packet Too Big (PTB) for ICMPv6 packet. Therefore, the Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) is not supported.The transit gateway enforces Maximum Segment Size (MSS) clamping for all packets. For more information, see RFC879.For details about Site-to-Site VPN quotas for MTU, see Maximum transmission unit (MTU) in the AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide.Multicast
