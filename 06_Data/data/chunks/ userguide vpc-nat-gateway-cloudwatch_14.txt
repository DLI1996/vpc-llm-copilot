You can create a CloudWatch alarm that sends an Amazon SNS message when the alarm changes state. An alarm watches a single metric over a time period that you specify. It sends a notification to an Amazon SNS topic based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods.For example, you can create an alarm that monitors the amount of traffic coming in or leaving the NAT gateway. The following alarm monitors the amount of outbound traffic from clients in your VPC through the NAT gateway to the internet. It sends a notification when the number of bytes reaches a threshold of 5,000,000 during a 15-minute period.To create an alarm for outbound traffic through the NAT gatewayOpen the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.In the navigation pane, choose Alarms, All alarms.Choose Create alarm.Choose Select metric.
