To restart the stopped instance, select the instance and choose Actions, Instance State, Start. In the confirmation dialog box, choose Yes, Start.If your instance is an instance store-backed AMI, you can't resize your instance using the earlier procedure. Instead, you can create an instance store-backed AMI from your instance, and launch a new instance from your AMI using a new instance type. For more information, see Creating an instance store-backed Linux AMI in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances, and Creating an instance store-backed Windows AMI in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances.
