Attachments — You can attach the following: One or more VPCs A Connect SD-WAN/third-party network appliance An AWS Direct Connect gateway A peering connection with another transit gateway A VPN connection to a transit gatewayTransit gateway Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) — The maximum transmission unit (MTU) of a network connection is the size, in bytes, of the largest permissible packet that can be passed over the connection. The larger the MTU of a connection, the more data that can be passed in a single packet. A transit gateway supports an MTU of 8500 bytes for traffic between VPCs, AWS Direct Connect, Transit Gateway Connect, and peering attachments. Traffic over VPN connections can have an MTU of 1500 bytes.
