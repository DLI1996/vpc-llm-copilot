Access VPCs in a remote Region by using a Direct Connect gateway. For information about Direct Connect gateway options, see Direct Connect gateways in the AWS Direct Connect User Guide.You can use a default subnet as you would use any other subnet; add custom route tables and set network ACLs. You can also specify a specific default subnet when you launch an EC2 instance.You can optionally associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your default VPC.Default subnetsBy default, a default subnet is a public subnet, because the main route table sends the subnet's traffic that is destined for the internet to the internet gateway. You can make a default subnet into a private subnet by removing the route from the destination 0.0.0.0/0 to the internet gateway. However, if you do this, no EC2 instance running in that subnet can access the internet.
