The following tables describe the default rules for a default security group.sg-1234567890abcdef0 All All Allows inbound traffic from all resources that are assigned to this security group. The source is the ID of this security group.0.0.0.0/0 All All Allows all outbound IPv4 traffic. ::/0 All All Allows all outbound IPv6 traffic. This rule is added only if your VPC has an associated IPv6 CIDR block.ExampleThe following diagram shows a VPC with a default security group, an internet gateway, and a NAT gateway. The default security contains only its default rules, and it is associated with two EC2 instances running in the VPC. In this scenario, each instance can receive inbound traffic from the other instance on all ports and protocols. The instances can't receive traffic from the internet gateway or the NAT gateway.
