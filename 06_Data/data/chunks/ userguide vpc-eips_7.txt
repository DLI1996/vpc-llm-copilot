(Optional) When you allocate an Elastic IP address (EIP), you choose the Network border group in which to allocate the EIP. A network border group is a collection of Availability Zones (AZs), Local Zones, or Wavelength Zones from which AWS advertises a public IP address. Local Zones and Wavelength Zones may have different network border groups than the AZs in a Region to ensure minimum latency or physical distance between the AWS network and the customers accessing the resources in these Zones. ImportantYou must allocate an EIP in the same network border group as the AWS resource that will be associated with the EIP. An EIP in one network border group can only be advertised in zones in that network border group and not in any other zones represented by other network border groups.
