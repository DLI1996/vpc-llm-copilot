right now might be the worst time to buy an iPad but if you're in that position I'm here to help let's get through this together welcome back to the channel guys why am I hiking why not at the time of filming it's September 2023 and let's be honest we have no idea what apple is going to do next when it comes to the iPad what's next for the iPad Air will they finally update the iPad Mini are we going to see an M3 powered iPad Pro what about the weird 10th generation iPad or the 9th generation iPad what are they going to do next more importantly if you need to buy an iPad today what do you do with a constant threat of Apple doing something around the corner my guess is that you've watched loads of these buying guide videos so far and you've ended up on this one in the hope that I'm going to give you a quick answer I am this won't take long and I can guarantee none of those videos were undertaken during a hike in the Peak District so even if you can't decide after this at least we've seen some nice scenery now I have omitted two iPads from this list the first one is the ninth generation if you need the cheapest iPad going just buy it the second one is the iPad Pro 11 inch I just don't get that iPad at all I think if you need an iPad of that size well I'll cover that in a bit just a quick word from today's sponsor which is paper-like and if there's one iPad accessory that is completely transformed every iPad I've ever used it's paper-like it's a screen protector that also turns your iPad's display surface into you guessed it something that feels like paper the effect is mesmerizing it's one of those accessories that when you first get it and put it on and use it your mind is blown fairly quickly for me the combination of the iPad Mini the second generation apple pencil and paper-like is absolutely magical if you're a writer an illustrator or you just like me take notes on your iPad it completely transforms it and it doesn't dull the screen the latest version 2.1 has a more evenly distributed nanodot technology for an even better feel and it's compatible with every single iPad you can buy and if you're worried about applying it and making a mess of your iPad and your brand new paper-like screen protector don't worry I've never had an issue and if I can do it you can definitely do it so to find out more about this game changing iPad accessory just click that link below let's start with the iPad 10th Generation can you believe that iPad is coming on for a year old well I reviewed it last year I called it the weirdest iPad Apple has ever made and I'm afraid that still holds true yes it has that modern almost bezel-less design and introduced The Fantastic magic keyboard folio but it's just weird a year on and I still can't think who that iPad is for it almost shouldn't be on this list I've included it because technically it's probably due an upgrade next year and if you don't want the ninth generation if that old design is too old for you and if the iPad Air is a bit too expensive although the iPad 10 isn't far off but if all those things hold true and I'm not holding that against you by the way then it's not a bad buy just bear in mind we might see one next year with some of those annoyances removed but I do think you can do better which is why you need to carry on watching this video next up we have the iPad Air which I think remains one of Apple's greatest triumphs because as it mixes Pro level functionality or almost Pro level functionality with a price that doesn't completely empty your bank account and that really important wantability factor and the fifth generation iPad Air has been a high point because it's the first iPad Air to ditch the a series chips in favor of the desktop class M1 and yes at the time of launch I was one of those people who said why on Earth have they put an M1 chip into the iPad Air now I understand why now that we finally have professional apps from Apple in terms of Final Cut Pro and logic pro both of which work fantastically on the fifth generation iPad Air it makes it even more of a bargain you're getting serious Pro level performance that you can actually put to use if you're not fussed about a pro motion display and a fancy camera system it does make the iPad Air a better buy in my opinion than the 11 inch iPad Pro there's just one issue which is that the current iPad Air was last updated in March 2022 which means next March which isn't that far away it's going to be two years old and that update would probably include an M2 Chip and possibly a pro motion display and yes if that happens I genuinely think it's curtains for the 11 inch iPad Pro so should you buy an iPad Air now well if you're absolutely desperate then yes get it it will be fantastic you won't regret it but if you're at all nervous about that impending upgrade and you can wait until let's say March next year then I'd wait next up the iPad mini and this is the iPad that I love the most but it's also the one I'm most concerned about I think the iPad Mini is the best iPad that Apple has ever made it's small enough to almost fit in your pocket yet powerful enough to do pretty much anything you ask of it it's the best note-taking device it's fantastic to consume content on it's just cute lovely and I just absolutely adore it and so does my audience there's so many people who still ask me questions every single day about the iPad Mini the problem is that it's two years old it's powered by the a15 bionic chip which is no slouch still works fantastically today but is well it's a bit long in the tooth as far as Apple silicon is concerned and it has two really weird storage options 64 gig or 256 gig basically it's ripe for an update there's been talk of a pro version of the iPad Mini for quite a while now and I love the idea of that the idea of adding a pro motion display an M1 or M2 Chip and please an apple branded magic keyboard case for the iPad Mini sounds incredible whether we get or just a mild update in the form of a new chip and perhaps some better storage options is anyone's guess but it's a dead cert that we're going to see something relatively soon in a recent back to school video I recommended the iPad Mini for kids if you've got the budget and for anyone who just cannot wait to get one if you just want an iPad Mini right now and I understand why get it but a little bit like the iPad Air if you're at all nervous about impending updates and I do think out of this list the iPad Mini is the most likely to get them relatively soon then I would hold your horses so what about the iPad Pro well Apple's Flagship tablet is a year old next month and I bought the 12.9 inch version back then and didn't even get it out the box I didn't review it I sent it straight back to Apple on the premise that I couldn't work out how to review it because at that point they weren't doing anything with that power however things have changed as I mentioned earlier we now have logic pro and Final Cut Pro from Apple and they have completely changed my perspective of the 12.9 inch iPad Pro finally we can put that M2 Chip to use properly so if you want the absolute best performance the best display the biggest display it's an absolute no-brainer there are rumors of an update next year with an M3 chip and possibly an OLED display and even if Apple does update it as soon as March next year that doesn't make the M2 version redundant and yes there's rumors of a super-sized 14 inch iPad Pro at some stage as well I'm not sure about that but even if Apple does surprise us with that next year how big do you need your iPad to be I think of all the iPads on this list the iPad Pro the 12.9 inch version is a very good buy right now this year was never going to be a big iPad year but that doesn't make it any easier to buy one the advice thankfully is pretty straightforward if you absolutely need or want an iPad now just buy it out of all Apple's devices iPads seem to last the longest they are fast for a long time the hardware holds up you're not going to regret your purchase but if you're at all worried about impending updates and you are the sort of person who would buy something and then regret it a year later because Apple brings out a new version weight because the good news is although we can't guarantee it obviously is that we are going to see iPad updates in some form within the next 12 months so it's easy if you can't wait you don't need to but if you can wait wait and if you didn't see my recent back to school video where I talk a little bit more about the iPad 6 keep watching for a link to that video
