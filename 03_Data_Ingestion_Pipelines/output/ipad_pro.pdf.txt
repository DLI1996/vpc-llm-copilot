Apple Regulated Substances Specification
 describes Apple’s restrictions on the use of certain chemical substances in
materials in Apple products, accessories, manufacturing processes, and packaging used for shipping products to Apple’s
end-customers. Restrictions are derived from international laws or directives, regulatory agencies, eco-label
requirements, environmental standards, and Apple policies. Every Apple product is free of PVC and phthalates except for
AC power cords in India, Thailand (for two-prong AC power cords), and South Korea, where we continue to seek
government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacement. Apple products comply with the European Union Directive
2011/65/EU and its amendments, including exemptions for the use of lead such as high-temperature solder. Apple is
working to phase out the use of these exempted substances for new products where technically possible.
Some features may not be available for all countries or all areas.
