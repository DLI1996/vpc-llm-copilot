A titanium gaming powerhouse\\nmovie camera phone? Is that even a thing? - Yes, it is definitely a thing. Titanium, the same material\\nused in spacecraft design, makes iPhone 15 Pro\\nand iPhone 15 Pro Max our lightest Pro models ever. Titanium's unique properties\\ngive it one of the highest strength-to-weight ratios\\nof any metal. - Which basically\\nmeans it's light enough to get up into space\\nand strong enough to make it all the way\\nback to Earth. Oops. - The new design\\ncomes in four Pro finishes and now includes\\na USB-C connector with superfast transfer speeds. And there's\\na customizable Action button for quicker access\\nto your favorite feature, from opening the camera\\nto activating a shortcut. iPhone 15 Pro\\ngets a major performance upgrade from the A17 Pro chip. With a new 6-core GPU\\nand a faster Neural Engine, it becomes a ridiculously\\npowerful mobile gaming machine, enabling higher-quality graphics\\nand rich, immersive game worlds never seen before\\non a smartphone. [SNARLING] - Whoa, these graphics\\nbring out every beautiful, disgusting detail. [ROARS] - It's truly horrifying. - It's a new chapter\\nin performance for iPhone and a new era of mobile gaming\\nfor the world. For photography,\\nthe new Pro camera system pushes the limits\\nof what you can capture with a smartphone. It's like having\\nseven pro lenses at the ready, ranging from 13-millimeter focal\\nlength on the Ultra Wide camera to 120-millimeter\\non the new 5x Telephoto camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max. - Tell her to take four steps\\nto the left, please. - The Pro Max gets iPhone's\\nlongest optical zoom ever, using a first-of-its-kind\\ntetra prism design. - It's like having\\na huge telephoto lens, but it's just in there. - And the more advanced\\n48-megapixel Main camera brings super-high resolution\\nto photos, which can now be turned into\\na portrait after you've shot, with an adjustable focus point\\nfor an all-new level of control. - That's better. - And when it comes\\nto filmmaking, it's now possible to record\\ndirectly to an external drive, enabling iPhone 15 Pro\\nto shoot in ProRes 4K at 60 frames per second. - Action!\\n[REVVING] - So the camera captures\\nevery detail of this. [EXPLOSIONS] - Cut! - With up to 20 times faster\\ntransfers enabled by USB 3 and support for pro formats, the workflow between\\nshooting and post-production is massively improved. - So I can take that footage\\nand do this and this, and voilà, cinema. - A little less magenta. - She's right. - Whether big movies\\nor everyday videos, professional-level filmmaking\\nis in the palm of your hand. So yes, a movie-making,\\nhigh-res-shot-taking gaming powerhouse built\\nwith aerospace-grade titanium. iPhone 15 Pro is the most\\npowerful iPhone ever made.
