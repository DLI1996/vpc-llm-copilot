Use the [wk<html>TOpdf download page](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) to download (or install it with a package manager). Note that there's also the option to install using one single line of cmd according to [packaging](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging). This is not necessarily a part of the workflow we had in mind, and thus, the installation process is not added in the main `README.md`"
