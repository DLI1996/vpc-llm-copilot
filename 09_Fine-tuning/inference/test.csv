What are AWS managed policies for Network Access Analyzer and how do they function?,"AWS managed policies for Network Access Analyzer are predefined permission sets that make it easier to assign permissions to users, groups, and roles within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. AWS services are responsible for maintaining and periodically updating these managed policies to support new features or operations, ensuring that permissions do not get removed and existing permissions do not break. Notably, these managed policies cannot be modified by users. For instance, the AmazonVPCNetworkAccessAnalyzerFullAccessPolicy is an AWS managed policy that provides comprehensive permissions for creating, analyzing, and deleting Network Access Scopes, as well as describing various network path resources like firewalls and gateways. Additionally, AWS also offers managed policies designed for specific job functions across multiple services."
